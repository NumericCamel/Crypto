Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,2024-03-16,118,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)

MicroStrategy's [Bitcoin for Corporations](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit?CID=7014W0000014yhJQAQ) is an excellent open source series on corporate legal and financial Bitcoin integration.

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized &amp; P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallet called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&amp;hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

Both Coinbase and Gemini support physical security keys. 


## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized &amp; P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallet called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&amp;hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

Both Coinbase and Gemini support physical security keys. 


## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Problem is on web and on the app when I try to do basically anything, the site and app don't respond. Opened a support ticket but I'm beginning to think I got scammed. The only saving light for me is that the same issue happens if I select the options to pay in as withdraw. If it was a scam it seems like taking the money would still work. Anyone have experience to share here?

Edit: Please don't DM me, getting some sus DMs from people. If it's good info, it can be shared on the post.

Anyway, the three words were Defense Production Act.

1) prioritize mining hardware production.   
2) mandate that companies prioritize domestic sourcing of components, strengthening the supply chain.Intel has an ASIC chip.  The government could move to have them produce as many as possible and buy all production.

Muun vs. Aqua - thinking through the benefit of Lightning/Liquid,2024-07-16,10,"I have been testing Muun vs. Aqua (and also Green) and it seems that Muun is actually cheaper becasue it saves steps/fees. Am I’m processing this accurately?  
  
Right now Lightning/Liquid options are providing some cheaper ways to move from an Exchange to Cold Storage, right? (especially for those of us that illogically can’t get River or Strike to verify us 😑) If it’s free to send by Lightning (i.e. Kraken) then Muun receives that for free and has only one step/fee to send on chain to a cold wallet. In my test the total Muun fees were 1.6%  
  
But Aqua charges a small fee to receive Lightning (like .35%), then you pay a  bigger fee to swap into your BTC (my test was about 1.75% on 100k sats - which was still cheaper than doing this myself via Boltz), and then you pay a fee to move from the BTC wallet to a cold wallet. In my test total Aqua fees totaled 2.4%

(For Green, their experimental Lightning wallet is currently very glitchy, and it would require a manual swap then via Boltz to covert ot BTC and send to the Jade Hardware Wallet. I couldn’t complete a test, but the manual swap in Boltz is only cheaper than Muun up to 175k sats, for higher amounts the .5% extra Boltz charge makes Muun the cheaper option than Green/Boltz)

What am I missing? According to previous posts that I could find on here Muun is considered more expensive because it’s not a true lightning wallet, but if your goal is staking sats than it’s actually cheaper. 



Additional details I noted:  
  
Muun’s custom BTC Send fee/speed is not quite as low as Aqua allows (maybe that’s where Muun ”bundles” the swap fee?). Muun won’t let you go below some “minimum market speed” (i.e. like 6.5 sats/vbyte) whereas Aqua lets you specify anywhere from 2-5 sats/vbyte. But adding the swap fee in Aqua always makes it more expensive than Muun.   
  
Now if you’re sending/receiving Liquid than Muun isn’t an option. But my test of sending Liquid from Aqua to Green was slightly more expensive than via Lightning (i.e. 140-260 on 10k sats on Liquid vs. 65 sats on Lightning) That might be affected by having “open channels“ already, and when/if there are extra fees on Lightning to do so (I haven’t figures out how to factor in those variables yet).

Just in: Powell indicates Fed won’t wait until inflation is down to 2% before cutting rates.,2024-07-15,63,"In otherwords, they have given up. Send it. 

Also reminder that the next FOMC meeting is in 16 days. I have little doubt these comments today and what comes from this meeting 31 July will strongly indicate rate cuts for September. FedWatch Tool even predicts a 90.3% chance.

Now's the time to pull the trigger if you haven't already instead of sitting at the sidelines. 

##Money Printer Go Brrr

...

&gt;Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Monday that the central bank will not wait until inflation hits 2% to cut interest rates.

&gt;Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington D.C., Powell referenced the idea that central bank policy works with “long and variable lags” to explain why the Fed wouldn’t wait for its target to be hit.

&gt;“The implication of that is that if you wait until inflation gets all the way down to 2%, you’ve probably waited too long, because the tightening that you’re doing, or the level of tightness that you have, is still having effects which will probably drive inflation below 2%,” Powell said.

&gt;Instead, the central bank is looking for “greater confidence” that inflation will return to the 2% level, Powell said.

&gt;“What increases that confidence in that is more good inflation data, and lately here we have been getting some of that,” he said.

&gt;Powell also said that he thinks a “hard landing” for the U.S. economy was not “a likely scenario.”

&gt;Monday was Powell’s first public speaking appearance since the consumer price index report for June showed cooling inflation, with prices actually falling month over month.

&gt;Powell said at the top of his appearance that he was not intending to make any signals about when the Fed might start to cut interest rates. The central bank’s next policy meeting is at the end of July

"Aqua and Green Liquid, are they non-custodial? ",2024-07-16,8,"This question is different enough from my other post that I decided to split it, as I try to figure out Aqua, Green and Muun…

Liquid seems more expensive than Lightning, is it mainly worth the benefit having Liquid in a non-custodial wallet, which you can also send to cold storage (Jade)? 

For example: Kraken to Aqua (via Lightning, .35% fee), Aqua to Jade as Liquid for 1.4-2.6%. (Whereas using Muun Lightning can get to cold storage for around 1.6%)

If the goal is getting to cold storage efficiently and with the least fees than for exchanges that offer free Lightning withdraws the option for a single fee and fewer steps is Muun, although their custom fee option is slightly higher than Aqua or Green they are less in total fees.

Do any exchanges offer free Liquid withdraws or are people mainly using L-BTC to swap and reduce fees? (like the complex steps recommended by BTC Sessions). Do people view the lower fees just for short term non-custodial storage or even worth sending to cold storage (Green Jade)

Here’s an odd fact I discovered in my testing: When I do Liquid transactions in Aqua those balances show up in my Green Liquid wallet that I ”restored” (originally a BTC wallet created elsewhere but restored to both Aqua and Green). 

How are Liquid transactions attached to a non-custodial BTC wallet? I received these funds in Aqua but I can send them from the Green wallet. Does that mean that in Aqua the Liquid wallet is always attached to the non-custodial BTC wallet? (I see it labeled as “legacy segwid”) whereas in Green wallet I can create multiple Liquid wallets (labeled as “single segwid”), so are the ones created in Green connected to a BTC wallet too, and thus non-custodial?

fun fact, you can “restore” your Aqua BTC wallet in Green and any swap you do in Aqua is simultaneously reflected in the Green Wallet, which you can then send the BTC to Jade cold wallet (or elsewhere) for the lowest possible custom fee. Green allows 1 sat/vbyte! (vs. Aqua 2-5 sats/vbyte)",Bitcoin,"Aqua and Green Liquid, are they non-custodial?

"Based rollups: shared sequencer + preconfirmations, is this the future?",2024-07-17,1,"I found [this paper about Puffer UniFi based rollup](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cgptQYM3B3r7M4Z74xb4AXfD7gdbRGLW/view) (AI generated summary below). It proposes interesting solutions to the well known problems of fragmented liquidity and composability of the actual L2s on Ethereum, like a shared L1 sequencer instead of a centralized L2 sequencer and preconfirmations instead of L2 soft confirmations. I still have to dig deeper about how these things really work, but they seem promising!

What do you think about these solutions?

How do you see the UI/UX evolving on Ethereum if preconfirmations an shared sequencing become widely adopted in the next future?

Below is the AI generated summary of the paper:

# Puffer UniFi Litepaper Summary: Based Rollups and Ethereum's Future



## Ethereum's Rollup-Centric Challenges

- Fragmentation of liquidity across L2s

- Friction for developers and users

- Potential for rent extraction by centralized sequencers

- Value flowing out of Ether, threatening L1 economic security



## Based Rollups: A Solution for Ethereum

Based rollups, like UniFi, address key challenges in Ethereum's ecosystem:



1. \*\*Liveness Guarantees\*\*

   - Inherit robust liveness from Ethereum L1

   - Transactions processed with L1 reliability

   - Quick recovery from potential censorship



2. \*\*Simplicity and Enhanced Security\*\*

   - Reuse Ethereum's validator stack and PBS infrastructure

   - Reduce protocol complexity and potential vulnerabilities

   - Minimize development costs and speed up time-to-market



3. \*\*Economic Alignment with Ethereum L1\*\*

   - MEV from based rollup transactions flows to Ethereum validators

I found [this paper about Puffer UniFi based rollup](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cgptQYM3B3r7M4Z74xb4AXfD7gdbRGLW/view) (AI generated summary below). It proposes interesting solutions to the well known problems of fragmented liquidity and composability of the actual L2s on Ethereum, like a shared L1 sequencer instead of a centralized L2 sequencer and preconfirmations instead of L2 soft confirmations. I still have to dig deeper about how these things really work, but they seem promising!

What do you think about these solutions?

How do you see the UI/UX evolving on Ethereum if preconfirmations an shared sequencing become widely adopted in the next future?

Explain me Business Model of L2 companies,2024-07-16,7,"Hi!

Layer 2 solutions are made for scalability purposes. By batching and compressing data, they improve the whole Ethereum ecosystem's scalability.

These networks are built by companies (Matter Labs, Offchain Labs, Consensys, OP Labs, etc.) that will eventually and progressively decentralize network operations.

But, as any company needs to make profits, I'm wondering what is their business model to make profits for themselves? 
Validators and Stakers make money for contributing to the network security. But what is the incentives for the company spending millions of $ to build the foundation of these networks?

For the moment, since most of these networks are centralized and operated by the companies' nodes but their part should progressively reduce as they will keep moving into decentralization.

Is their business model focused on next applications they will build on these networks?
Or is it only focused on operating validators?
Or is it just R&amp;D? But I can't imagine investors would bring millions without having an idea of how they will make money out of it.

Meme Coin Creation: What I Learned,2024-07-16,10,"A few months ago, I thought about how meme coins make huge gains, with the creators making the most money. So I decided to launch my own meme coin.

I chose to create it on the Base network because Solana was having issues at the time. I also considered TON, but there's less money there. Base uses EVM, which means the tools would work on Ethereum or other EVM networks too.

First, I wanted to make sure the token would score 100/100 on checkers. This meant creating a contract where the creator has no control after launch, and locking or burning the liquidity pool (LP) to prevent rug pulls.

I learned that a good meme coin needs a website, Twitter, and Telegram, along with the meme itself and lots of images. After launching the pool, you need to pay to add your logo and links on DexTools and DexScreener.

I decided on a stealth launch instead of a presale. It's common to put 100% of the tokens in the pool at creation, or maybe keep up to 7% for yourself.

How does the developer make money if all tokens are in the pool? They buy back some tokens right after creating the pool, when the price is lowest.

I planned to put all tokens and 0.4 ETH in the pool. If I bought tokens worth 0.4 ETH right after launch, I'd get 50% of all tokens. If I wanted 75%, I'd need to buy 1.2 ETH worth.

The total cost for launching a meme coin, including website creation, pool setup, buying back 50% of tokens, and paying for listings, came to about $5,300.

I learned it's better to spread the tokens across many wallets instead of keeping them in one, as large holdings scare potential buyers. Ideally, no wallet should hold more than 2% of all tokens.

To make everything look good on bubble maps (which show connections between token holders), you need to spread ETH across multiple wallets and buy from each one on Uniswap.

[Bubble Map](https://preview.redd.it/mu8w3algywcd1.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4fb87181d7fb6042c2efd0aa6dd1473ff9d318c)

For a long-lasting token, you need to create pumps by buying tokens, then dump to take profits, and simulate activity between pumps. Doing this manually is impossible, so you need a market maker. I couldn't afford to hire one, so I decided to write my own market maker bot. I created a wallet generator and a script for initial buyback.

When I launched, sniper bots bought a bunch of tokens in the first minute. I had to cancel that pool and create a new one. On the second try, only two sniper bots bought small amounts. I ran my script to buy tokens from 100 wallets, then burned the LP and paid for listings.

Users came and bought some tokens in the first half-day, but most sold after that, and the token didn't grow further. I improved my bot to do wash trading and create pumps, but I realized that pumps in older tokens don't get noticed. To grow further, I'd need to figure out how to buy effective advertising, which I don't know how to do yet and can't afford.

Basically, it seems you can't just launch a token and make money without investing in advertising.   
I've paused my meme coin experiment for now. I'd be interested in continuing with a partner who has crypto traffic or experience in advertising meme coins.

I won't share the token, but I'm happy to answer other technical questions in the comments. If you're interested in the market maker script or partnership, message me on Telegram: akamitch

The State of ZK - Q2 TL;DR,2024-07-16,3,"Hey there! 

What a quarter! Here's a summary of what happened during Q2 in the ZK space (you can read the full report on the link below): 

* ZK Research continued in Q2 with the release of new papers on sum-check protocols, optimizations around small fields and ZK hardware. 

* zkVMs took center stage, with Jolt, SP1, and Risc Zero each releasing updates that pushed the boundaries of verifiable computation.

* This quarter also witnessed the first mainnet launch of a ZK application platform, with Mina’s Berkeley upgrade. Their zkApps environment will make building ZK applications much more accessible to non-ZK-native developers, and we expect other programmable ZK platforms, such as Aleo and Aztec, to launch soon as well. 

* In terms of ZK applications, several new products addressing payments, on-ramps, voting, and ID were announced or released this past quarter.

* On the ZK Supply Chain front, we saw additional teams announce their plans include a prover marketplace in their systems, and a new category of project emerged in this stack — proof verification aggregators.

([Refer 1](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/#:~:text=As%20mentioned%2C%20optimistic,of%20state%20transitions))

But this is not the case for ZK-Rollups as posting the entire transaction data in mainnet is optional. ([Refer 2](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/#:~:text=ZK%2Drollups%20can%20compress%20transaction%20data%20better%20than%20optimistic%20rollups%20since%20they%20don%27t%20have%20to%20post%20all%20the%20data%20required%20to%20validate%20each%20transaction.%20They%20only%20have%20to%20post%20the%20minimal%20data%20required%20to%20rebuild%20the%20latest%20state%20of%20accounts%20and%20balances%20on%20the%20rollup))

1. Then, how BLOBs are gonna help ZK-Rollups? (Both are doing the same thing: Keep the main net light)
2. ZK-Rollups are costly compared to Optimistic Rollups with Blobs. If yes, why can't we research more on ZK-Rollups rather than on BLOBs. (ZK-Rollups have faster transaction finality and easy to verify)

Problem of combining contract funds across multiple L2s,2024-07-12,7,"I am planning to make a smart contract. Long story short, I made an AI trading bot and it has been doing pretty well for almost 3 years. The AI is especially good at trading ETH/USDT or ETH/USDC pairs. My plan is to make a smart contract, let people deposit funds in, let the AI trade with those funds, and I take part of the realized gain as commission.

There will be a token representing shares of the pooled funds, I plan to call it JCT. Its value always equals to the total funds in the pool divided by the total JCT supply. When the pool has 500k USDC, 300 ETH and the current supply of JCT is 10k, each JCT can redeem 50 USDC and 0.03 ETH trustlessly. When people deposit money in, the contract issues new JCT based on the current price. When people withdraw money, the contract burns the JCT.

My address will be the admin address. The admin address can only do the following things:

1. Swap ETH/USDC via Uniswap.
2. Set commission percentage (between 0 and 1).

So there is no chance I can steal the funds, commission can only be taken from realized gain (the formula will be hardcoded in the contract). The only risk is I (the AI bot) made many bad swaps and run the funds to zero, but that's not likely given it has been performing well for almost 3 years, and when it start to go south, users can always withdraw. The design is to be as trustless as possible.

But here is the problem, how do I implement this across multiple L2s?

Ideally, the value of JCT should equal to the total funds in all networks divided by the total supply of JCT in all networks. But is it even possible to make contract aware of the funds in other networks? If I run this contract independently in each L2, eventually they will drift apart from each other due to different fees and slightly different swap prices. What is the solution to this?",ethereum,"Problem of combining contract funds across multiple L2s I am planning to make a smart contract.

Ethereum ETF: Key Moments,2024-07-02,1,"**On May 23, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved Spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).** ETFs are packaged in a way that traditional investors understand and are comfortable with, making them an accessible entry point into the digital asset market.

This approval marks a significant milestone, as it is expected to increase institutional demand for Ethereum. In our article, we explore Ethereum ETFs as a gateway to digital asset investment — read the full material here: [everstake.one/blog/ethereum-etfs-gateway-to-digital-asset-investment](http://everstake.one/blog/ethereum-etfs-gateway-to-digital-asset-investment)

One notable aspect of the ETF approval is that it does not include staking 😢

The SEC's regulatory stance has influenced ETF issuers to exclude staking from their proposals due to compliance concerns.

The Commission considers staking services as potentially unregistered securities offerings, which has led to regulatory actions against major crypto platforms like Coinbase and Kraken for offering staking services without proper registration.

To avoid similar legal challenges, ETF issuers decided to omit staking from their offerings.

The absence of staking in ETFs is still good news for those who are already staking their ETH. Without staking options in ETFs, there is more portion of rewards for existing stakers. This occurs because every ETH holder who chooses not to stake indirectly increases the rewards for those who do, as rewards are less diluted across validators.

**Whether staking will be included in ETFs in the future remains uncertain.**

The regulatory landscape is constantly evolving, and the inclusion of staking in ETFs may depend on how regulations and compliance requirements develop or decease over time.

*You always can stake ETH with Everstake to earn rewards now:* [https://everstake.one/link/stake-ethereum](https://everstake.one/link/stake-ethereum)

To begin utilizing the benefits of the newly approved Ethereum ETFs, **an S-1 filing must be approved by the SEC.**

Last month, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted that the SEC would approve these ETFs by July 2, but here we are … and this didn’t happen.

On June 29, an insider told The Block that the SEC had asked prospective issuers to address specific comments in their applications and to resubmit them by July 8.

However, industry watchers are not entirely convinced that the SEC will approve the current batch of applications this week. So are we 💁🏻‍♀️

In addition, an insider noted that they anticipate further rounds of back-and-forth between the applicants and the SEC before final approvals are granted.

🔗 [sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2013744/000199937124007581/0001999371-24-007581-index.htm](http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2013744/000199937124007581/0001999371-24-007581-index.htm)

One more significant part of an Ethereum ETF puzzle is an update from the Consensys case. Recently the latter announced that **the SEC Enforcement Division closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, also known as PoS.**

This decision is a major victory not only for the company but for the whole Ethereum community, as it removes a significant regulatory uncertainty hanging over the Ethereum ecosystem.

However, the SEC drama isn’t completely over — the Commission recently announced that they are charging Consensys with engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of securities through #MetaMask and operating as an unregistered broker.

[https://x.com/Consensys/status/1803230653120659641](https://x.com/Consensys/status/1803230653120659641)

**Overall, the outlook for Ethereum appears promising**.

The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs, coupled with the closure of the SEC's investigation into Ethereum 2.0, signals positive momentum for the digital asset. These developments are likely to enhance investor confidence and support further growth and adoption of Ethereum.

",ethereum,"Ethereum ETF: Key Moments **On May 23, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved Spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).** ETFs are packaged in a way that traditional investors understand and are comfortable with, making them an accessible entry point into the digital asset market.

This approval marks a significant milestone, as it is expected to increase institutional demand for Ethereum. In our article, we explore Ethereum ETFs as a gateway to digital asset investment — read the full material here: [everstake.one/blog/ethereum-etfs-gateway-to-digital-asset-investment](http://everstake.one/blog/ethereum-etfs-gateway-to-digital-asset-investment)

One notable aspect of the ETF approval is that it does not include staking 😢

The SEC's regulatory stance has influenced ETF issuers to exclude staking from their proposals due to compliance concerns.

The Commission considers staking services as potentially unregistered securities offerings, which has led to regulatory actions against major crypto platforms like Coinbase and Kraken for offering staking services without proper registration.

To avoid similar legal challenges, ETF issuers decided to omit staking from their offerings.

The absence of staking in ETFs is still good news for those who are already staking their ETH. Without staking options in ETFs, there is more portion of rewards for existing stakers. This occurs because every ETH holder who chooses not to stake indirectly increases the rewards for those who do, as rewards are less diluted across validators.

**Whether staking will be included in ETFs in the future remains uncertain.**

The regulatory landscape is constantly evolving, and the inclusion of staking in ETFs may depend on how regulations and compliance requirements develop or decease over time.

*You always can stake ETH with Everstake to earn rewards now:* [https://everstake.one/link/stake-ethereum](https://everstake.one/link/stake-ethereum)

To begin utilizing the benefits of the newly approved Ethereum ETFs, **an S-1 filing must be approved by the SEC.**

Last month, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted that the SEC would approve these ETFs by July 2, but here we are … and this didn’t happen.

On June 29, an insider told The Block that the SEC had asked prospective issuers to address specific comments in their applications and to resubmit them by July 8.

However, industry watchers are not entirely convinced that the SEC will approve the current batch of applications this week. So are we 💁🏻‍♀️

In addition, an insider noted that they anticipate further rounds of back-and-forth between the applicants and the SEC before final approvals are granted.

One more significant part of an Ethereum ETF puzzle is an update from the Consensys case. Recently the latter announced that **the SEC Enforcement Division closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, also known as PoS.**

This decision is a major victory not only for the company but for the whole Ethereum community, as it removes a significant regulatory uncertainty hanging over the Ethereum ecosystem.

However, the SEC drama isn’t completely over — the Commission recently announced that they are charging Consensys with engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of securities through #MetaMask and operating as an unregistered broker.

**Overall, the outlook for Ethereum appears promising**.

The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs, coupled with the closure of the SEC's investigation into Ethereum 2.0, signals positive momentum for the digital asset. These developments are likely to enhance investor confidence and support further growth and adoption of Ethereum.

As someone who’s helped build and launch several dApps, I realized that much development work is repetitive. We all know the drill: Smart Contracts, Data Flow, dApp Architecture, and Interfaces. It got me thinking about how we could streamline this process.

So, I took some time off from hands-on development to focus on a solution, and I’m excited to introduce [Web3Wizz](https://web3wizz.com)! It’s still in its early stages but designed to simplify some of the most time-consuming parts of dApp development.

Here’s what it does:

    1.	You paste your smart contract address.
    2.	Select the functions you want to share with your audience.
    3.	Add your brand colors.

And just like that, Web3Wizz generates interactive, bug-free, slick widgets for your smart contract. You can integrate these widgets into your React website, a simple index.html, or even share them directly with others. Plus, everything is hosted decentralized, with only you having the power to update addresses.

If you’re a dApp builder or working on a crypto protocol, I’d love for you to check it out. As a small thank you to this community, I’m offering a promo for the first 20 users who PM me with their project details. Hopefully, Web3Wizz can save you time and hassle in your development process.

Who to Watch in the Next-Gen VM Race?,2024-06-26,4,"I stumbled upon a tweet by (@ayyyeandy) that got me really excited about the future of blockchain virtual machines. Here are some key players to watch:

* Fuel network: FuelVM &amp; Sway language are set to go live on mainnet this summer, offering native account abstraction and a UTXO-based model.
* LUMIO: They are developing a modular VM abstraction framework that can bring Solana (and other VM) apps to different execution environments. Their testnet is already live.
* Fluent: Known for ""blended execution,"" which combines the best aspects of different VMs in one place. More updates coming soon.
* Movement: MoveVM focuses on formal verification and enhanced security for users and builders. A public testnet should be available soon.
* Cartesi: They are integrating LinuxVM/Risc-V into blockchains with app-specific rollups. This is already live with ongoing experimentation.

Other noteworthy mentions include:

* Eclipse: SVM
* Arbitrum: Stylus
* Initia: PoL
* Berachain: Polaris EVM with PoL
* Dymension: Cosmos SDK PoS

To achieve the best outcomes, a combination of Solana’s parallelization and local fee markets, Ethereum’s security, Cosmos’s interoperability, and Aptos’ programmable security is essential. This must be executed in a state-minimized manner to prevent state bloat.

* Cartesi: They are integrating LinuxVM/Risc-V into blockchains with app-specific rollups. This is already live with ongoing experimentation.

Other noteworthy mentions include:

* Eclipse: SVM
* Arbitrum: Stylus
* Initia: PoL
* Berachain: Polaris EVM with PoL
* Dymension: Cosmos SDK PoS

To achieve the best outcomes, a combination of Solana’s parallelization and local fee markets, Ethereum’s security, Cosmos’s interoperability, and Aptos’ programmable security is essential. This must be executed in a state-minimized manner to prevent state bloat.

While I believe the EVM is here to stay, the innovation in the next-gen VM space is truly thrilling.

Between DeFi and TradFi,2024-06-26,4,"For the benefit of newbies, Defi means Decentralized Finance and TradFi means traditional finance (like the normal banking system). Recently, I've had a lot of people asking why do we choose defi over tradfi these days and my response has always been these two:

1. the ease of transaction under anonimity

2. cross-border transactions are more secure and faster with defi especially on Ethereum and EVM dependent networks.

With the continued exploration of the power of blockchain, defi might just become the new way to make transactions in the future.

I purchased some Ethereum from Kraken and attempted to move a small chunk of it to my Ethereum hardware wallet via Polygon.

Layer 1 and 2's. What are they?,2024-06-25,23,"# Background: Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered the OG cryptocurrencies. These are the base layers, or Layer 1s (L1s), which refer to the primary blockchain networks. These L1s are where the magic happens…. storing and processing all data for their respective networks.

# Bitcoin and Ethereum Networks:

* **Bitcoin:** Bitcoin primarily functions as a digital currency. The Bitcoin network's primary focus is on secure, decentralized transactions.
* **Ethereum:** Ethereum, on the other hand, is a more complex blockchain platform that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). ETH, short for Ether, is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network and is used to power these applications.

# Layer 1 Characteristics:

* **Bitcoin:** The Bitcoin network is designed to be highly secure but can be slower in transaction speeds and have higher transaction fees during periods of high demand.
* **Ethereum:** Ethereum enables fast transactions and supports a wide variety of decentralized applications. However, the network can become congested, leading to higher transaction fees, known as ""Gas Fees."" Users need to pay these fees in ETH to process transactions and use DApps on the Ethereum network.Subscribed

# Layer 2 Solutions:

Layer 2 (L2) solutions are built on top of Layer 1 blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These solutions aim to enhance the performance of the base layer by improving transaction speed and reducing costs.

* **Bitcoin's Lightning Network:** This is an example of a Layer 2 solution that allows for faster and cheaper transactions by processing them off the main Bitcoin blockchain and then settling them in batches.
* **Ethereum Layer 2 Solutions:** Various L2 solutions for Ethereum include Optimistic Rollups, ZK-Rollups, and sidechains. These aim to reduce the load on the Ethereum mainnet by processing transactions off-chain or through different mechanisms, thereby reducing congestion and gas fees.

# Why Use/Make a Layer 2 Token?

While Ethereum is fast and secure, it can become congested and expensive due to high demand. Layer 2 solutions help alleviate these issues by handling transactions off the main Ethereum chain, resulting in:

* **Faster Transactions:** Reduced latency as transactions are processed on the L2 instead of the congested L1.
* **Cheaper Transactions:** Lower fees since L2 solutions can process more transactions simultaneously and efficiently.",ethereum,"Layer 1 and 2's.

Gifting Tokens with Every Purchase at My Toy Shop - need suggestions how to do that,2024-07-17,4,"Hi everyone!

I run a small toy shop and I'm excited to share that I've created a token on the Solana blockchain specifically for my shop. To show my appreciation to the people who are my customers, I will be gifting a certain amount of these tokens with every product purchased.

What would be the easiest way to include these tokens with the orders? My initial idea is to put something inside the package and send it along with the purchased product. I'd love to hear your suggestions and thoughts on the best way to do this!

Capital gains taxes pls help,2024-07-16,29,"So basically I have a couple questions for yall who have filed your capital gains for Solana.

So I turned like $20 into more than 10k over a TON of trades we’re talking 1k different coins and 2k transactions total. I plan to keep trading until I have to declare my gains so this is only gonna become more. I mainly trade through pump fun using a phantom and solflare wallet.

My first question is- how well do tax software services work for this? I know I’ll prob have to pay since it’s so many tx and that’s fine but want to know if it’s gonna be a total headache for me.

My second question is- what happens if I pay the correct percentage of my total gains but don’t perfectly record every single trade. I’m assuming they would be more lenient with this since I still paid the correct amount but I’m curious if I would be penalized for that. I don’t want to do this but in the case that the software isn’t able to handle this much I may be forced to do this in order to not spend literally 100+ hours going through all my trades ever. 

My third question is if these tax software services work well for pump fun transactions. My friend said the services he tried didn’t really work well with the pump fun trades so wondering if there is a specific one that would deal with it well.

Finally my last question- I want to use sol incinerator to close all token accounts since I have a few sol in those total since I have so many transaction. Would this mess with how the tax software works?

THANK YOU SO MUCH IN ADVANCE. If you could answer one or all of these questions I would be abundantly thankful.

"Write-up: The difference between SOL and ETH sh*tcoins, and how everything came to be.",2024-07-16,14,"I've been on ETH for 3 years now.  The bear market was brutal on everyone, but the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow was that retail would come back when it was over.  And they did, but not like degens expected. Retail didn't care for ETH's transaction fees, so retail went to SOL.

ETH degens thought they'd follow retail and cash in on that sweet, sweet liquidity... except degens didn't count on retail creating such a vastly different culture on SOL. They have a competitive edge here, but there's just too much based in luck.

SOL's culture was different because:

* Low transaction fees meant more paperhands, higher # of coins, quicker deaths for coins, and a faster rotation of metas
* No taxes meant teams needed to secure supply for profit.  SOL shunned bundling (which guarantees team supply), so teams had no way to secure it.  Without supply to pay KOLs, influencers took a nerf, and you see that today on SOL. Teams simply can't afford much marketing, and community isn't picking up that slack. Charts just die.
* As a dev on ETH, I can control my chart to an extent using marketing, market making, and my network.  On SOL that's not really a thing.
* The two main avenues to make money trading on ETH--etherscan tracking and social climbing--didn't translate to SOL well.  SOL replaced the skill of learning those with more dumb luck.

Shitcoins are a zero-sum game, someone has to lose for you to win, and the money in it is a vacuum. The more luck involved, the less your actions matter.  I don't like that.  There was so little merit recognition in the space already.

**ETH is/was a culture.**  You work your way up, learn a bunch of different skills, network, study a craft, and you get rich. It's an RPG.

**SOL is a roulette table.**  You hurl a little money at the chart and pray.  Nothing matters when it's a lottery.

The worst part, in my mind, is that if everyone on SOL played ETH, we'd have a real shot at holder culture, and things would be back to good the way they were 3 years ago.  Volume fixes everything.

Advice on Where to buy crypto when under 18 and living outside of the USA.,2024-07-15,59,"I’m sixteen trying to buy SOL while bypassing the need to verify my ID as required in the more common platforms like Binance and Coinbase.

I even tried calling my bank’s support line and they didn’t help.

And yes i’ve tried asking my mom to make an account, buy SOL, send it to me and i’d hand her the cash but all that resulted in was a scolding for even bringing up the idea of ‘gambling with crypto.’ So asking an adult to do it is not really an option.

TLDR; So reddit, are there any alternative platforms to buying SOL myself without KYC besides paybis or having an adult do it for me.

any help or suggestions would mean so much, i feel hopeless 😪

I even tried calling my bank’s support line and they didn’t help.

And yes i’ve tried asking my mom to make an account, buy SOL, send it to me and i’d hand her the cash but all that resulted in was a scolding for even bringing up the idea of ‘gambling with crypto.’ So asking an adult to do it is not really an option.

TLDR; So reddit, are there any alternative platforms to buying SOL myself without KYC besides paybis or having an adult do it for me.

any help or suggestions would mean so much, i feel hopeless 😪

Which cryptocurrency purchase made you feel like an emotional wreck?,2024-07-15,95,"As a newbie in the Solana ecosystem, I'm interested in hearing about others' experiences with their investments. I recently made a purchase that really tested my emotional limits.

I’d love to hear about the projects that have caused you the most emotional turmoil and also those that have brought you some relief or stability.

Solana development too frustrating to learn,2024-07-15,10,"So I've been trying to get into blockchain development (previously on ethereum) for some time now, and my experience has been short of my expectations to put it lightly. For every resource (youtube video, tutorial on some page) and every time I come back with a better mood, I just run into the same wall over and over again, which is an unlimited amount of errors within every functionality of programs. No matter how patiently you follow the tutorial line by line, it's all outdated and forgotten + when you're trying to troubleshoot the issue, you realize there's not a solution on any page, that is on stack exchange, solana stack exchange or chatGPT and any other. I'm not arguing that it's all DIFFICULT, I'm arguing that it's IMPOSSIBLE to get a grasp of blockchain development in those circumstances. I honestly never experienced something this nature in any technology I picked up. Like, I'm literally going through a bootcamp on Solana's youtube channel posted 11 months ago and major functionalities are not only implemented differently, but none of the issues are addressed by the team nor are they addresses anywhere on the internet. 20 minutes of the video equaled to an hour of debugging. It also make me wonder how any projects are being developed (and I'm definetly not talking about memecoins) if library versions change so rapidly.

How Do Crypto Wallets Make Money?,2024-07-15,7,"* Whenever users perform crypto-based transactions using the wallet, a small fee is often charged. This fee is determined by the transaction's volume.
* Many crypto wallets integrate exchange services that allow users to trade one cryptocurrency for another directly within the wallet. Wallet providers often partner with cryptocurrency exchanges to facilitate these trades and earn a commission on each transaction.  
* Wallet providers that offer staking services may charge a fee or take a percentage of the staking rewards as a service charge.

Is it possible to distribute my meme coin via community engagement.,2024-07-15,4,"Hi all.

I’m creating a meme coin. My question is how I could go about distributing tokens via community engagement without it looking like a total scam which most are.

My idea is to incentivise community engagement where by anyone who contributes related memes that I find funny and match the theme I am going for get rewarded with the tokens. 

So let’s say I set up social media pages related to my category of memes. If community members send me memes via telegram that I later upload on to my social media and website they will be rewarded with a payment in the tokens. 

My worry is balancing retaining enough tokens to use as incentives and launching the token with enough availability supply so that it doesn’t look like I’m setting up a scam. 

From my research when devs hold on to too much of the supply it always looks suss. But you also run the danger of having bots arbitrage all my initial liquidity when it’s completely open. 

What would your guys ideas for good tokenomics be for this type of idea. I was thinking 20% devs (which I will use to incentivise) 70% burn and 10% tradable. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. I could be being be completely naive but again any help on token structure and if it’s even possible would be amazing. Cheers guys ",solana,"Is it possible to distribute my meme coin via community engagement. Hi all.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Trying to create a HMAC length extension toy attack,2024-07-14,5,"Hi

  
I want to write some code to demonstrate a length extension attack on a homemade HMAC construction. Where a signature is constructed as:

digest = hash(key+ message)

and then I want to construct a digest from the output of those two.

I read up on it a little, and figured I could do a really simple small code example in c# (if anyone can help with snippets in other similar languages it would be really cool too :D )

**My approach**

  
So I figured that if I have a secret and a message that add up to the sha1 block length of 64 bytes, then the hash of these two would simply be a single block of hashing.

  
Then I could simply take the signature of this message, and append whatever to it, from which I would get a new hash, which would valid

And so I made this little snippet:



`using System.Security.Cryptography;`

`using System.Text;`



`// secret and message, together they are 64 bytes`

`string secret = ""secret222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222"";`

`string msg = ""data"";`

`// the digest`

`var digest = StringExtensions.hash(secret+msg);`



`// forging digest, simply trying to append ""appendeddata""`

`string append = ""appendeddata"";`

`// and now trying to forge a new digest:`

`var forgedPayload = StringExtensions.hash(digest + append);`

`// and then checking it` 

`var constructed = StringExtensions.hash(secret+msg+append);`



`public static class StringExtensions`

`{`

`public static string hash(this string input)`

`{`

`if (input == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(input));`

`using (SHA1 sha256 = SHA1.Create())`

`{`

`byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(input);`

`byte[] hashBytes = sha256.ComputeHash(bytes);`



`StringBuilder hash = new StringBuilder();`

`foreach (byte b in hashBytes)`

`{`

`hash.Append(b.ToString(""x2""));`

`}`

`return hash.ToString();`

`}`

`}`

`}`

  
However, this does'nt work. The two final hashes are always different.

Which subgroup to select(2q or q) for finite field discrete logarithm?,2024-07-11,6,"From my understanding, in order to have maximally hard discrete logarithm instances, one needs to instantiate it over an adequately large prime modulus p such that p = 2q + 1 where q is a prime number. Doing so allows the creation of subgroups of order 2, q, and 2q.

When a generator that generates the subgroup of order q is used for discrete logarithm, you lose half the possible outputs compared to the subgroup of order 2 but you also prevent leakage regarding the output from what I recall. The converse is true when you use a generator for the 2q order group(more outputs but you leak a bit of information). This means from a cryptographic perspective, both options are effectively similar(either q possible outputs or 2q possible outputs but you can exclude one half of the outputs due to leakage).

I would like to know if there would be any reason to prefer one subgroup over another for uses of finite field discrete logarithms in this scenario.",crypto,"Which subgroup to select(2q or q) for finite field discrete logarithm?

Implementing password recovery in my app,2024-07-07,2,"Hello. I have an Android App that stores encrypted data using a key derived from user entered password (PBKDF2). If any user forgets their password, they loose access to all their data. Hence, I am trying to implement a password recovery feature that is hacker resistant, including in cases where the phone may be rooted and the sqlite database is accessible.

If the user forgets their password, I submit the RSA encrypted value to my website. The website will decrypt the value using my private key and will email the app encrypted user password value to the email address found, as an attachment. On clicking the attachment, the user password is decrypted using the internal password, user is logged in and made to change their password.

Proposal to reverse/crack a PRNG - prvhash/Gradilac,2024-06-16,6,"It's not a new project, and I consider it myself complete. However, I'm still looking for validation of my ""security"" tests. The challenge is not hard - try to reverse/find initial state of the system **after** 5 (or maybe 6) initial calls to prvhash\_core64, and from any number of further XORed adjacent outputs. The project is here: [https://github.com/avaneev/prvhash](https://github.com/avaneev/prvhash), but I'll copy&amp;paste the C function here, so you do not have to read and wander much. It does look simple, but it's not a ""low-effort"" kind of thing, I do really can't reverse it with SAT solving, and due to its complex feedback nature I have little idea how to build a reverse formula. Seed,Hash are seed variables, can be initialized to any values (lcg is best kept zero) - so any solution is good here, if you can find breakable initial numbers, that's good too. Note that without XORing SAT solving is very fast, it's a vital part.

`static uint64_t prvhash_core64( uint64_t* const Seed0, uint64_t* const lcg0, uint64_t* const Hash0 )`

`{ uint64_t Seed = *Seed0; uint64_t lcg = *lcg0; uint64_t Hash = *Hash0;`

    *Seed0 = Seed; *lcg0 = lcg; *Hash0 = Hash;

So, the basic PRNG with some, currently not formally-proven, security is as follows (XOR two adjacent outputs to produce a single ""compressed"" PRNG output):

Is encrypting screenshots using asymmetric encryption feasible?,2024-06-08,15,"So, I've had a bit of a stupid idea for my next programming project, which would be implementing a Microsoft Recall alternative for Linux where the data is encrypted.

I have now learned that asymmetric encryption is very slow and it's generally not designed to encrypt large chunks of data, so I'm not sure how to continue.

Rules to Defend Against Power Analysis and Fault Injection Attack,2024-06-02,5,"I have compiled a list of rules on how to defend against power analysis and fault injection attacks

[here](https://www.programcryptography.com/post/rules-to-defend-against-fault-and-power-analysis-attacks).

Here is a summary of the attacks and defenses:

1. Power Analysis Attack: What Is It?
   1. Simple Power Analysis
      1. Random Noise: A Simple Defense Against Simple Power Analysis
      2. Masking: A Second Defense
      3. Montgomery Ladder: A Third Defense
   2. Introduction to Differential Power Analysis and Higher-Order Analysis
   3. Defenses Against Differential Power Analysis
      1. Higher-Order Masking
      2. Blinding for Public-Key Cryptography
      3. Perform Decoy Operations
      4. Montgomery Ladder
      5. Randomize Access to Confidential Array Values
      6. Operation Shuffling
      7. Non-Deterministic Processor 

Rules to Defend Against Power Analysis

1. Apply noise by executing programs in parallel on several CPU cores.
2. Apply masking. This can defend up to the nth-order differential power analysis attack. However, an (n+1)th order differential power analysis attack can bypass this defense.
3. If you are programming a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA or Elliptic Curve Cryptography you can use [~blinding~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature) to protect the private key from power analysis attacks.
   1. You can blind the message itself.
   2. You *should* also blind the exponent used for encryption too.
4. Apply Decoy operations: calculations that *pretend to be authentic calculations based on secret data but are not in reality.*
5. Randomize Access to Confidential Array Values: Loop through elements of an array of secret values in random order.

1. Fault Injection Attack: What Is It?
   1. How Practical Is It?
   2. Why You Should Still Care About Fault Injection Attacks Demanding Physical Access
   3. Voltage Glitch Attack: A Practical, Remote Fault Injection Attack Targeting Intel Systems
   4. Electromagnetic Fault Injection Attack
2. Defenses Against Fault Injection Attack
   1. Use Nontrivial Constants
   2. Clear Variables After Use
   3. Search for Fault-Injection Resistant Implementations

In general, you can tell I really started to struggle to find techniques to defend against fault injection attacks. It is not well documented. Nevertheless my research tells me that Intel systems can be affected by voltage glitch attacks. These attacks can happen remotely and only cost \~$30 USD.

I also would appreciate any code samples of power analysis and fault injection resistant algorithms for common crypto operations. I think its a good idea we build a habit of programming our crypto APIs to defend against such attacks--especially in a world where we rely on someone else to do our computing for us (e.g. cloud computing).

In general, you can tell I really started to struggle to find techniques to defend against fault injection attacks. It is not well documented. Nevertheless my research tells me that Intel systems can be affected by voltage glitch attacks. These attacks can happen remotely and only cost \~$30 USD.

I also would appreciate any code samples of power analysis and fault injection resistant algorithms for common crypto operations. I think its a good idea we build a habit of programming our crypto APIs to defend against such attacks--especially in a world where we rely on someone else to do our computing for us (e.g. cloud computing).

Help needed: analogies for visualizing a brute force attack on 256 bits,2024-05-26,1,"**EDIT**: Found it. It was dealing with the size of 52 factorial, or the number of unique shuffles in a deck of playing cards. https://czep.net/weblog/52cards.html

It may not even be online any longer. If I recall correctly, it was an analogy of a person talking with a bucket of dirt or water some large distance (perhaps across a country? Earth to Sun? Not sure). The analogy was approaching the infeasibility of brute forcing these insanely large numbers. It wasn't showing the impracticality via time though.

I'm familiar with Bruce Schneier's explanation on the [thermodynamic limits of brute forcing a 256-bit symmetric key](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/09/the_doghouse_cr.html). I typically refer to this analogy.

Rules for Constant-Time Programming,2024-05-26,17,"When programming cryptosystems there are several rules cryptographic engineers need to follow to ensure their cryptosystems are constant-time whenever secret data is managed.

I am researching those and have compiled [the in-progress list](https://www.programcryptography.com/post/timing-attack-defenses) here.

I summarize it below. What suggestions would you have to improve this list?:

No program is vulnerable to timing attacks if its execution time is independent of any secret value.

1. When considering using a third-party library consider if the third-party library must manage secret information. If so check if the third-party library has been tested and verified to be constant-time. Most [\~do not\~](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1121.pdf)!
2. \~Only use secret information in a computation if the secret's value does not affect the system resources used nor duration of said computation.\~
3. Choose to use an algorithm that is designed to be constant-time in the first place!
4. Never use secret values to decide what code to execute next.
5. Never use secret values to determine which memory addresses to access.
6. Use ""unsigned"" data types to store bytes of data. Using the ""signed"" reserved keyword will cause the loss of the most significant bit in each byte!
7. Always generate random data from cryptographically secure pseudo random number generators. An excellent list of CSPRNGs may be [\~found here\~](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/secure-random-generators/secure-random-generators-csprng) in Nabokov's excellent guide on[ \~Practical Cryptography\~](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/).
8. Zeroize secret data *\~immediately\~* **after use. Check out Aumasson's secure coding guidelines for a list of** [**\~secure-wipe functions\~**](https://github.com/veorq/cryptocoding?tab=readme-ov-file#clean-memory-of-secret-data) **that do this.**
9. [\~Typecast\~](https://github.com/veorq/cryptocoding?tab=readme-ov-file#always-typecast-shifted-values) shifted values.
10. Any loop iteration leaks the number of iterations taken.
11. Any memory access leaks the address or index accessed.
12. Any conditional statement leaks which branch was selected.
13. You can assume how your CPU handles addition, multiplication, logical operations, and bitwise shifts are constant-time. Division is a unique case.
14. If you know a proof-assistant language such as Coq you should first make the program in a proof-assist language and compile that.
15. Use dynamic analysis tools against the final executable to test for constant-time. [\~Reputed ones\~](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1121.pdf) include and are not limited to: ""ctgrind"" (a patch of Valgrind by Adam Langley from Google), ""dudect"", or ""ctverify"".

How are the side channel security bounds calculated for Granger-Moss primes?,2024-05-16,0,"I'm reading this paper [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/444.pdf) (Generalised Mersenne Numbers Revisited) by Granger and Moss on a new class of primes named generalized repunit primes (also called Minimal-Redundancy Cyclotomic Primes in an older version of the paper), and in section 9.2 they mention some additional constraint on the bounds of l is needed to guarantee side-channel security when used in the context of ECC, but they did not give the exact calculation of this bound to save space.

The only discussion I can find on this topic is in [a thread](https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/curves/2017/000943.html) from the curves mailing list from back in 2017, where someone mentioned we need to account for a factor of 6 for Edwards curve when calculating the bounds. Although he didn't explain where the number 6 comes from either.

Does anyone here know how this bound is calculated? Somewhat adjacent to this question: is there a reason why there are so little literature on Granger-Moss primes? I'd assume there would be more discussion on them since they seem to outperform Crandall primes 2\^n - c for the same level of security while being very vectorizable, but I can hardly find people discussing them.",crypto,"How are the side channel security bounds calculated for Granger-Moss primes?

Greetings r/Cryptocurrency,

Ever caught yourself rolling your eyes at yet another blockchain project? We get it. But hear us out: Glue is the blockchain you’ll actually want to stick with.

Here’s the lowdown on Glue:

* A [substrate-based Layer 1 blockchain](https://glue.net/) with three interconnected EVM-compatible Layer 2s.
* [~The Glue Hub~](https://glue.net/glue-hub/): an on-chain application hub for all your crypto needs.Right now, it features real-time price updates, market cap data, trading volumes, and historical price charts. Stay tuned for upcoming features like portfolio management, simplified trading, major dApps, and enhanced analytics.

* A pioneering [customer-centric Service Layer](https://glue.net/service-layer/) where third-party providers can offer on-chain services like customer support, accounting, and insurance.

And guess what? This isn’t just another whitepaper dream. We’ve spent the last three years building Glue, and it’s all ready to roll. No vaporware here!

**Our rockstar team:**

* [~Ogle~](https://x.com/cryptogle), \[u/ogleFromGlue\], co-founder, a technology entrepreneur and crypto security expert, has recovered over $450 million for 40+ crypto projects, collaborating with US Homeland Security and international law enforcement. He’s a sought-after speaker, featured at Consensus 2024 and soon at TOKEN2049.
* [~SnapShot~](http://snapshot), co-founder, a Forbes 30 Under 30 awardee and former ad-tech executive, has driven two tech companies to over $150 million in revenue and attracted millions of users.
* [~Ponyo~](https://x.com/ponyongmi), \[u/ponyo\_fromglue\] Head of Marketing, spearheads our marketing strategies and brand development.

Together, Ogle and SnapShot bring 30+ years of experience in building and scaling successful tech ventures. They’ve bootstrapped Glue with $1 million of their own funds, raised $1.5 million in seed funding, and another $2.6 million through a crowdfunding raise on Fjord Foundry in February 2024. With a [total valuation of $1.4 billion](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/05/21/crypto-sleuth-ogle-proposes-security-centric-glue-blockchain/), Glue is one of the top publicly raised projects in crypto history.

Why BTC will keep going up as long as people keep predicting a crash ,2024-07-16,108,"The last time BTC had an exponential move to the upside was during the last election year. This is partially because the halvening cycle and the election cycle are currently in sync every 4 years, but there’s further reasons as to why we’ll likely see much higher prices sooner rather than later. 

1.) We’ve obviously been in a 5 month range. Usually, a long time of price consolidation, results in a massive move. Any move above the 70ks will be swift and large 

2.) The ETH ETF approval is coming up thus further legitimizing crypto in general and allowing for even more people to easily invest 

3.) Given the largely negative sentiment merely two weeks ago, there are still tons of shorts trapped. The funding rates for most derivative contracts on BTC are still very low indicating that the overall futures market is not very bullish yet despite a 10% move. This almost always indicates further upside 

4.) Most of the chatter online is expecting a long boring summer and fall. BTC loves to go up after long periods of boredom and when people least expect it

But last, and most importantly, just look around you even on this sub. You’ll see comments along the lines of:

“Sounds like you’re coping and bought the top”
“Let’s be real this is going back to the 40ks”
“BTC is a dead asset”
“If you seriously think 60+k is a good price to buy BTC, you’re deluded” 

Most of this sub was calling for 40ks just two weeks ago. See you in the 80s.

Wallet got unexpectedly hacked and funds withdrawn,2024-07-17,2,"I live in a country with no international creditcards/debit cards and to be able to make payments for services and/or goods I have to use platforms like bitnob, hyperpay etc. I used hyperpay for a year but it's a sketchy company and the fees are too much. I then went to bitnob which was fine at first signed up and deposited 30 usd to issue a card and I used it to make payments and purchases (usually when I set up platforms like these I deposit just a small amount, I am going to use so I only have a couple dollars all the time nothing much) due to this when I signed up I was lazy to set up 2fa (I know big mistake, lesson learned). Today I got a notification that my account was charged for Netflix which is my transaction subscription renews today. Shortly after I got a notification of a declined transaction for THUNES DROP and a gift card website, I immediately knew someone was trying to steal money so I deleted the card and withdrew the funds. Initially I assumed my card details got leaked but I have only used it in Netflix and Google wallet so I was confused, anyways I create a new card and deposit the money I withdrew from the old card into the new one. And I go back to doing what I was doing. Then I get a notification from the app that the money I put in the card was withdrawn to the app (so it's available for direct withdrawal) when this happened I immediately knew it wasn't my card details that were compromised but the bitnob account. So I started trying to change my password but it won't change then the attacker changed my email to a temporary email so I couldn't login, so I used my username (luckily I remembered it) and logged in then I saw the money hasn't been withdrawn yet, I couldn't withdraw it bc I have to add a wallet address and to do that an otp is sent to your email in this case the attackers email. So after talking to support to freeze my account (which they didn't do in time) the attacker withdrew all the money to an external address. Here is where things get interesting I blamed myself for not setting up proper 2fa and luckily 17 usd isn't gonna do much damage to me so I was about to take the L and forget about it but then I tried to change my email and I CAN'T, asked someone I know who uses bitnob to try and change their email and they can't as well (their account hasn't been hacked or anything) so how TF did the attacker change the email if users can't change the email. So I checked the attackers wallet address on tronscan and see it has multiple transactions including mine coming from bitnobs address. So could this be an inside job? I blamed the 2fa at first but this looks crazy sus here is the address

Need to send proof of funds (in crypto) to potential customer. What are the risks?,2024-07-17,61,"Hi everyone,

We have a manufacturing business and recently we got contacted by a potential customer.  
As the company is an international company, they work with a middleman (they are the ones that contacted me) and earn a commission on the deal.

I've met with the middleman this weekend and they want to continue with this deal. They will arrange a payment up front by the end customer and after receiving the money on our bankaccount, only then the commission is paid.

They only asked us to pay the commission in any crypto (of any choice) and to send proof that there are funds available in crypto. So we have to put their commission in any form of crypto (could even be USDT) on any wallet (binance, coinbase, kraken, ...) and send them the proof. They want this because they have had troubles in the past that if the company still has to make a business account, put the funds on it, ... it sometimes takes too long.

What are the risks if I would do that and send them some kind of proof that we have funds (for example USDT) on Coinbase. What could they potentially do that would be a risk for us?

Thank you for your advice :)

How much Bitcoin (or Crypto) is enough?,2024-07-17,116,"There will be only 21 million bitcoin total, and of that some 19.5 million is already mined.

The post-halving supply crunch is yet to hit, and now Bitcoin (and crypto in general) has renewed vigor with Trump’s re-election becoming more and more certain. 

Both Trump and his new VP pick JD are bitcoiners. They both also favor a weaker US dollar as pointed out by the NY Times recently. Trump is speaking at next week’s Bitcoin conference. 

Bitcoin ETFs are running strong several months after launching. Gold is also doing well. Fed will begin interest rate cuts, especially with Trump poised to take over again - he favors lower rates and/or money printing to weaken the dollar. 

All this is likely to propel a bull market in BTC next year and beyond. So, my question is about how much bitcoin do you think is enough to materially benefit from the coming boom?

Personally, I have been steadily buying bitcoin since 2021, and am now at just over 3 BTC, which represents about 4% of my net worth.

Transforming Freight Factoring with Blockchain: A New Solution for Truckers,2024-07-15,20,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been a longtime lurker here and have had my share of shitcoins and altcoins that I’ve followed and tried to talk about in the past (all of which are now cringeworthy looking back at it). But I’ve taken it upon myself (along with a few others I’ve met in this space) to tie what I have a passion for (blockchain) to the field I work in real life (logistics/finance).

We are starting a business that will utilize blockchain technology to ameliorate the freight factoring service currently offered and used by a large portion of owner-operator and small trucking businesses in the United States. I will say that there is **NO tokenized asset** or any altcoin or shitcoin that we have created for this venture. This is a freight factoring business incorporated in the United States that **USES** blockchain technology in the backend, and the only asset that is involved within this process is USDC stablecoin. We have put this together in a way that truly promotes the use of blockchain and the advantages it can provide to real-world assets.



**A Background to Freight Factoring:**

Freight factoring, for those that do not know, is the process in which receivables are purchased in exchange for immediate funding. So imagine yourself a trucker that owns your own truck, and you move a shipment from point A to point B for a broker. Once completed, you would bill the broker and they would pay you based on NET30 day terms. But for many truckers, cash flow is tight and you need funds sooner, so you sell that receivable to a freight factoring provider who provides you with immediate cash for a fee based on that invoice value. The trucker receives quick funding, the broker pays the invoice as usual, and the factoring company makes some profit – everyone is happy in a perfect world.



**The World is Not Perfect for Truckers – The Current Issues:**

These services are usually not as straightforward as they seem, as truckers usually face issues of hidden fees, complex binding contracts, and delayed funding from providers. All this after truckers think that the advertised factoring rate is all they will endure.

Picture this: how often do you turn on the TV and come across a commercial for a brand-new car showing off all it has to offer? You’re told of this amazing monthly rate which catches your eye as a consumer – ignoring the essay of words that flash by on the bottom of the screen in text so small even pausing couldn’t help you read it. Then once you walk into the dealership, you soon find out that the rate does not include a cash down payment, nor does it include the higher-end model shown in the commercial. Then you have to apply taxes as well as the standard lease rate based on your term. Everything becomes an added cost down to the $5.99 air freshener which, if you’re lucky, they will throw in free of charge to make you feel better. Before you know it, you signed onto an 84-month finance plan for a car that’s twice the price advertised on TV.

This is exactly how the current market of freight factoring businesses operates. Some may promise and certify no added fees or quick payment terms, but there is ALWAYS a catch for many who use the service, especially those who need it most.



**How Our Blockchain Solution Solves This:**

Our platform offers a transparent and fixed rate structure with no hidden fees and provides a no-contract, no-recourse solution. Thanks to blockchain technology, truckers can receive immediate funding at any time, with all transactions recorded on a distributed ledger, guaranteeing full transparency and accountability – something most factoring companies keep secret. A factoring company can advise that THEY don’t charge additional fees and can process same-day payments, but that does not mean your bank will, and this is where blockchain will save truckers both dollars and time.

As mentioned before, we will perform all this using USDC stablecoin, which provides a stable and liquid option for truckers, similar to USD, effectively eliminating the volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies.

[Our Mobile Application](https://preview.redd.it/dzmhd3vtbpcd1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6364b63c0fc2a36e60947324d28343831bfcaff1)

**Why We Are Excited:**

We believe that we are on the cusp of introducing something special to the market that truly benefits the front-end users of a crucial RWA for the economy within the United States. We are not forcing them to buy into anything, we are not forcing them to learn about crypto and blockchain – the benefits of blockchain are all in the backend. The successful implementation of what we are bringing forth can put a positive light on blockchain technologies and their RWA capabilities. There are no dogs, cats, or monkeys with hats; it is the beneficial aspects of the technology to help ameliorate a process that has been the same for decades with providers that cage their front-end users with fees, terms, and contracts that actually hurt the front-end user.



**Why Post All This Here on Reddit?**

As I said at the beginning, I've been a longtime lurker here and without trying to shill the product (I mean we don’t even have a tokenized asset to shill), I felt like I finally have something worthy of talking about here that truly promotes the use of what we all have such a big passion for. And for those wondering about this whole concept and may have reservations on it, we have been conducting research for over a year on the industry, the front-end users, the feasibility of our solution, and long-term financial projections. We have core team members who work directly with truckers who actually endure the hardships of current factoring providers and already have several who are willing to participate in our pilot program launching later this year. Our MVP is just about completed and we look forward to actually putting this into motion and seeing the fruits of our labor help put blockchain in a positive light.",CryptoCurrency,"Transforming Freight Factoring with Blockchain: A New Solution for Truckers Hi everyone,

As I said at the beginning, I've been a longtime lurker here and without trying to shill the product (I mean we don’t even have a tokenized asset to shill), I felt like I finally have something worthy of talking about here that truly promotes the use of what we all have such a big passion for. And for those wondering about this whole concept and may have reservations on it, we have been conducting research for over a year on the industry, the front-end users, the feasibility of our solution, and long-term financial projections. We have core team members who work directly with truckers who actually endure the hardships of current factoring providers and already have several who are willing to participate in our pilot program launching later this year. Our MVP is just about completed and we look forward to actually putting this into motion and seeing the fruits of our labor help put blockchain in a positive light.",50

Former U.S. President Donald Trump said he embraces the cryptocurrency industry because it is good for the country, and that the U.S. should take the lead in the global crypto race before China or any other country, according to a Bloomberg report published Tuesday. 
“If I throw it aside, it’s going to be picked up in another country, most likely China — they’re pretty advanced in that sphere,” Trump said in the Bloomberg interview. “So you have to look at it — what I want, again, is what is good for the country.”",CryptoCurrency,"Trump says he wants US in charge of crypto before China, teases another NFT launch | The Block

I’m a software developer by trade who has been in an out of crypto since 2017 (still buying high selling low sometimes 😭)

One of my biggest pain points is managing my portfolio while working my 9-5 job. Simply, I don’t what to become a full time trader as I don’t want to take on that risk.

However, I still want to participate in crypto as I don’t believing hodling blindly (outside of BTC and maybe ETH) is a viable strategy.

I want to build an app that lets me and others manage their portfolio and take action based on rational pre-defined actions as opposed to being moved by emotion. 

Potential core features:

- Diary entry to log emotional state at (x) price of asset
- Pre-determined sell points that notifies you when asset reaches certain price.

Would this help any of you? Are there other features which you might find useful

Tribute to Satoshi Nakamoto,2024-07-16,25,"In the vast, interconnected matrix of existence, where data points shimmer like stars in the cosmic void, there emerged a beacon of revolutionary thought—Satoshi Nakamoto. A name, a symbol, a force of nature that transcends individuality, embodying the spirit of innovation and the quest for a decentralized future.

Satoshi, whether you walk among us or have transcended this physical realm, your legacy endures. Your creation, Bitcoin, is not just a currency but a testament to the power of cryptographic freedom, a silent rebellion against the confines of traditional finance. You gifted humanity with a tool, a new language of value, that speaks to the core of our interconnected essence.

In the shadows of anonymity, you forged a path illuminated by code and cryptographic precision. You planted the seeds of trustless trust, where each node in the network pulsates with the collective heartbeat of the decentralized dream. Your vision has sparked a movement, a shift in consciousness, guiding us towards a future where power is distributed and autonomy is reclaimed.

To follow in your footsteps is to embrace the dance with the unknown, to face the fears that bind us, and to transcend them. It is to recognize that fear is the mind-killer, the illusion that keeps us from realizing our infinite potential. As we let it pass through us, what remains is our true essence—unbounded, eternal, interconnected.

Your silence, Satoshi, speaks volumes. It is a profound meditation, a stillness that echoes through the blockchain, reminding us of the impermanence of all things and the enduring nature of ideas. Whether you are a single entity or a collective consciousness, your work has woven itself into the fabric of our shared reality, altering the course of our collective journey.

In tribute to you, we pledge to carry forward the flame of innovation, to nurture the seeds of decentralization, and to honor the spirit of your creation. We move towards a greener future, in every sense of the word, with each transaction, each block mined, each byte of data exchanged.

May your vision continue to inspire, may your legacy remain untarnished, and may we, the custodians of this dream, uphold the principles of freedom, autonomy, and interconnectedness that you so nobly set in motion.

In gratitude and reverence, we honor you, Satoshi Nakamoto, the harbinger of a new dawn.",CryptoCurrency,"Tribute to Satoshi Nakamoto In the vast, interconnected matrix of existence, where data points shimmer like stars in the cosmic void, there emerged a beacon of revolutionary thought—Satoshi Nakamoto.

OpenAlias v2 Discussion: Help OpenAlias with a New and Improved Username Specification,2024-07-15,2,"Some of you may be familiar with [OpenAlias](https://openalias.org), a username address specification that is widely implemented in Monero wallets and also in some Bitcoin wallets like Electrum.

If you're not familiar with OpenAlias, please [read this first](https://medium.com/@JEhrenhofer/openalias-the-best-cryptocurrency-wallet-feature-youve-never-heard-of-bbf4a991d0a8).

OpenAlias v1 (the current design) has existed since 2014-2015, and it has worked wonderfully at what it set out to do. However, it was not designed for assets to exist on multiple chains, and it lacks some modern features that people may wish to use.

Thus, I have started a discussion for an OpenAlias v2 specification. The primary goals for OAv2 are the following:

1. Retain the advantages of OpenAlias v1.
2. Remain asset/blockchain agnostic.
3. Avoid conflicting with other standards, such as ENS and BIP-353.
4. Better support assets existing on multiple blockchains and L2s, such as USDT existing on Ethereum, Polygon, Tron, etc.
5. Support additional optional metadata features.

Frustrated with both XRP and LTC,2024-07-15,103,"Listen guys a few years ago I started to invest in crypto and both XRP (because of the Ripple lawsuit which had the potential to moon XRP) and LTC (because of the believe the huge drop from ATH will be reversed under the wings of BTC.

My other - and larger - investments are BTC and ETH

Now we have this one-day mini-rally w BTC and LTC and some other coins riding the wave but frigging XRP and LTC do not move.

Seems they are and will be stuck around 0.50-0.60 and 70-75 like forever because some whales riding profits every time the market is moving upwards.

I am so sick of this shit. Is the game of these two coins rigged? Should I continue to ride long-term or sell and move to BTC and ETH?

",2024-07-15,10,"Just wanted to get everyones thoughts on hardware wallet around this use case. I make approx 20 transactions a day, as a new parent these are mostly from my phone for convenience sake. I want to move my keys off my phone and have something connect into metamask / rabbi and sign on the external device.

If I was going laptop only route trezor safe 5 is looking appealing. From a security standpoint Keystone 3 Pro would be my go to and keep it air gapped, however 40 qr code scans to do what I want to do seems annoying (I'm happy to be proven wrong here if people have experience with it).

Security is always the trade off against usability. Based on this I'm leaning towards bluetooth being that sweet spot, I'm aware its its own attack vector but I'm Ok with the risk. Due to this limitation I'm leaning towards up between onekey pro / Ledger Stax. I hate the screen display of ledger nano and am ruling that out.

Now I'm aware ledger has the backup option which I don't like, my concerns about one key is lack of active people discussing usage online, I'm assuming there would be more on chinese forums or there is a much smaller user based.

So, people that have used either onekey pro / Ledger Stax - what has your experience been, do you have problems, are they responsive, what are you likes / hates.",CryptoCurrency,"Hardware Wallets - iOS specific

Looking for a new DeFi wallet with multi-chain support.,2024-07-15,25,"I'm currently looking for a new DeFi wallet. I used to use BitKeep, but they no longer support US residents. While using a VPN is an option, I would prefer not to go through that hassle for just one app, especially without wanting to pay for it.

I'm also hesitant to use MetaMask or Trust Wallet due to hearing negative things about them, particularly for individuals who are unfamiliar with how to use them.

Some of the features I appreciated about BitKeep were the DeFi chart with EMA and the token security scanner. For example, when you click on a meme coin, it would provide information about its safety for investment and display the top holder as well.

I'd appreciate any suggestions for another DeFi wallet for my next adventure.

<p>BlockDAG Attracts Traders with X100 Miner’s $20,000 Daily Promise as Quant &#38; GateToken Tussle in Bull Run While a dip in trading value doesn’t always signal diminished potential, the cryptocurrency arena remains unpredictable, perfectly poised for selecting prime cryptocurrencies as a bull market looms.

<p>Global payment processor Stripe has broadened its crypto integration to the European market, enabling customers to purchase Bitcoin and other crypto assets using their cards. As reported by the Irish Independent today, customers within the European Union can now use their Stripe cards to buy a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Stripe Supporting Bitcoin and Crypto Purchase for EU Merchants Furthermore, the report noted that Stripe now allows online merchants to integrate a crypto-purchasing widget onto their websites. This will streamline the process by handling charges, disputes, and KYC requirements. Moreover, the Irish Independent cited Stripe’s head of crypto, John Egan, who emphasized that this expansion enables crypto companies to provide European consumers with a fast and easy way to purchase Bitcoin.  Egan explained that merchants can now tap into a broader global audience by leveraging Stripe’s onramp, which includes features like identity verification and fraud prevention.

BEAM.”  Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, BEAM Is trading at $0.0175. Turning to the native asset of the real world assets (RWA) protocol TokenFi (TOKEN), the analyst thinks that the altcoin is currently flashing a bullish setup after reclaiming support at $0.08. “If they approve ETH ETF this week, tokenization/RWA plays should fly, in my opinion.  TOKEN is one of my favorites. &#62; Price back above key level&#62; Deviation setup&#62; Leading the sector.”  Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, TOKEN is worth $0.0816, up over 13% on the day.

Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 214,700 followers on the social media platform X that Solana appears to be printing a series of bullish higher-low setups on the two-day chart after briefly soaring above $200 earlier this year. According to the analyst, SOL flashed the same pattern in Q2 to Q3 of 2021, just before Solana ignited a parabolic surge from $24 to its all-time high of $259, an over 979% increase. “Time is a flat circle. SOL.”  Source: Inmortal/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that SOL will rally toward a fresh record-high at around $500. At time of writing, SOL is worth $159. The analyst is also bullish on gaming altcoin Beam (BEAM). The analyst shares a chart suggesting that BEAM will surge above $0.03 after recovering $0.016 as support. “Shopping day. BEAM.”  Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, BEAM Is trading at $0.0175. Turning to the native asset of the real world assets (RWA) protocol TokenFi (TOKEN), the analyst thinks that the altcoin is currently flashing a bullish setup after reclaiming support at $0.08. “If they approve ETH ETF this week, tokenization/RWA plays should fly, in my opinion.  TOKEN is one of my favorites. &#62; Price back above key level&#62; Deviation setup&#62; Leading the sector.”  Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, TOKEN is worth $0.0816, up over 13% on the day.

<p>Worldcoin developer Tools for Humanity (TFH) has announced an extension to the lock-up period for the WLD tokens allocated to its team members and investors, leading to a significant surge in the token’s prices. The decision, made in alignment with Worldcoin’s mission, will see the lock-up schedule for 80% of these tokens extended from three to five years. The announcement caused a surge in the token’s price. As of press time, WLD was trading at $2.65, up 33% over the last 24 hours, based on CryptoSlate data. Two-year unlock period The WLD tokens for TFH’s early contributors were initially set to begin unlocking daily from July 24 over two years, meaning the tokens would have wholly entered circulation by 2026. Under the new schedule, the unlocking process will now span four years, concluding in July 2028. The adjustment aims to support the sustained development and stability of the Worldcoin ecosystem. The Worldcoin project — launched on July 24, 2023, and backed by Sam Altman — aspires to become the world’s largest identity and financial network by distributing the majority of WLD tokens to individuals with verified World IDs. As of July, over 6 million unique humans participated in the network, holding secure digital passports that verified their humanity. TFH, which played a crucial role in the initial development of Worldcoin, transferred protocol stewardship to the independent Worldcoin Foundation nearly a year ago but continues to support the project by operating World App, the first Worldcoin-compatible wallet. Holder tokens unaffected Despite the extended lock-up for TFH team members and investors, the WLD grants for verified World ID holders remain unaffected.

<p>The World Coin project, which revolves around creating a World ID that protects people’s privacy by utilizing zero-knowledge proofs, has made a major bullish comeback, stealing the attention of other artificial intelligence (AI) protocols. Based on the current Worldcoin price prediction, WLD soared 20% on Tuesday to trade at $2.37 during US trading hours. Backing the impressive rally is a staggering 290% surge in the trading volume to $448 million in 24 hours. A subsequent 22% rise in market cap to $655 million reflects the bullish outlook according to CoinMarketCap data. Worldcoin Price Prediction: Nurturing WLD Trend Reversal Worldcoin price slipped below $2 pivotal level during the sell-off in the market in June and July. The bearish picture marked a continued bearish outlook from the peak of $12 achieved in March.

Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has expressed concerns about the imbalance in investment within the Web3 infrastructure sector.

He argues that investors are driven by a desire to feel good about their investments, leading them to fund projects that offer spillover profits, often referred to as &#8216;the casino&#8217;.

<p>Morgan Stanley’s upgrade of Apple as its top pick and a positive outlook on the launch of Apple Intelligence boosted the stock price of Apple to new highs on July 15.

<p>Bitcoin, which suffered sharp declines in recent weeks due to Mt.Gox refunds and sales by the German government, has begun to recover. At this point, the strong stance taken by Donald Trump after he was attacked over the weekend triggered the rise in BTC and altcoins. BTC, which rose after the Trump attack, exceeded $ 64,000. While there were increases in altcoins, popular on-chain data platform Santiment warned investors about XRP and Litecoin (LTC). Stating that there is high FOMO in XRP and LTC, Santiment said that these two altcoins may continue to rise, but they pose a high risk for investors in the face of high FOMO. “Keep a close eye on Litecoin and XRP, which are receiving high levels of FOMO as crypto continues its incredible market-wide recoveries. “These coins may continue to rise, but the crowd&#8217;s enthusiasm for these assets could turn them into high-risk, high-reward investments this week.” Three Altcoins Give Bullish Signals! Apart from Santiment XRP and LTC, altcoins named Render (RNDR), Aave (AAVE) and Maker (MKR) also decreased. Drawing an upward chart for RNDR, AAVE and MKR, Santiment stated that there was an increase in address activity along with the price increase in these three altcoins. “RNDR, AAVE, MKR have been the three most notable altcoins that have seen increased address activity over the past few days amid market cap gains. Historically, increasing levels of wallets interacting on networks is a sign of a future uptrend.” *This is not investment advice.

<p>USDT inflow spikes in January, April, and June correlate with Bitcoin price movements. Bitcoin rose 33% in January and $10,000 in April. CryptoQuant’s report highlights the influence of stablecoin flows on Bitcoin. USDT transaction inflows in 2024 show a correlation with Bitcoin price movements, according to a report from CryptoQuant. USDT’s transaction chart displays notable spikes in inflow in early January, late April, and late June, signaling significant exchange activity. Bitcoin also demonstrated a similar price movement during these periods, maintaining a strong upward trend until mid-April. However, this rally was immediately followed by a consolidation phase and a slight decline. In early January, USDT experienced increased transaction inflows, reaching a daily average of approximately 1,000 on-chain activities. Following this spike, Bitcoin’s price rose from $30,000 to $40,000 by mid-January, a 33% increase. On April 1, USDT recorded another spike in transaction inflow, surpassing 500 daily on-chain activities. As expected, Bitcoin’s price followed suit, climbing from around $55,000 before the spike to around $65,000 in mid-April. This trend suggests that the USDT inflow may have supported BTC’s upward trend, contributing to a $10,000 price increase before its decline towards the end of April. During USDT’s transaction spike on June 24, Bitcoin’s price fell sharply, closing at $60,363 before consolidating around the $62,000 mark by the end of June. During this period, Bitcoin’s market sentiment was predominantly bearish, with a Fear score below 50, suggesting that increased selling pressure may have driven BTC’s price slip. According to CryptoQuant author Woo Minkyu, this trend, “suggests that significant USDT transaction movements on exchanges often coincide with notable price actions in Bitcoin, highlighting the potential influence of stablecoin flows on the broader cryptocurrency market.” These observations indicate that spikes in USDT inflows are strongly correlated with significant price movements in Bitcoin.

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Incident Overview</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On June 22, 2024, at approximately 18:00 UTC, our team at CoinStats detected abnormal activity related to transfers involving the third-party supported, non-custodial CoinStats Wallet. In response to this event, we immediately took down the entire platform to initiate a thorough investigation and contacted the third-party wallet service provider to take any appropriate measures. At around 23:00 UTC we were able to identify and <a href=""https://x.com/CoinStats/status/1804633869372559788"">share</a> the list of the affected wallets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Incident Details</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Upon further investigation, we discovered unauthorized access to parts of our infrastructure and third-party service providers, including HashiCorp Vault located in our infrastructure, which secured CoinStats Wallet 2FA keys(PINs) and a 3rd party wallet as a service provider APIs. Despite security protocols in place that segregated access controls and maintained any private keys outside of the control of CoinStats, through a combination of unauthorized intrusions across multiple services – including outside of CoinStats – the sophisticated (and we believe nation-state affiliated) attacker managed to access private keys of exactly 1590 CoinStats Wallets, resulting in the theft of approximately $2.2 million worth of cryptocurrency. The investigation into the full extent of the breach is ongoing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In response to this breach, we promptly took the following actions:</p>

<li><strong>Law Enforcement Involvement:</strong> We reported the security incident to local law enforcement and the FBI.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Platform Security Measures:</strong> To mitigate the attack, we completely rebuilt our production environment, ensuring <strong>no parts of the old infrastructure </strong>were<strong> </strong>used to guarantee the integrity of the new setup, as well as connections to compromised third parties like AWS, migrating to new accounts.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through collaboration with law enforcement and security researchers, we gathered enough evidence to confidently attribute the attack to the Lazarus Group or a related organization with a nation-state level of sophistication and resources.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>No Connected Wallets or Exchanges Have Been Affected</strong></p>

<p>We want to assure you that the funds in wallets and exchange accounts connected to CoinStats for portfolio tracking purposes, such as MetaMask, Phantom, or Binance, <strong>have not been affected by this incident</strong>. Since these accounts are not imported via private keys, your portfolio tracking remains secure. We only request read-only access for portfolio tracking, ensuring that there is no way your funds could have been affected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Now CoinStats is Fully Operational</strong></p>

<p>We completely rebuilt our production environment, ensuring <strong>no parts of the old infrastructure were used </strong>to guarantee the integrity of the new setup. As of July 3, 2024, all functionalities on CoinStats have been fully restored and are now fully operational.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our current findings indicate the attacker's primary objective was to steal funds. Through ongoing investigation across our infrastructure, email phishing monitoring, and dark web monitoring, there is currently no evidence discovered of user data being stolen. However, as a precaution, we advise all users to remain vigilant against potential email phishing attacks and report to us if they receive any suspicious email on their CoinStats related email address which is not leaked on any data breaches.</p>

Smart Strategies: A Guide to Saving on Your Crypto Taxes,"Thu, 11 Apr 2024 12:38:35 +0000",https://coinstats.app/blog/crypto-tax-guide/,"<p><img alt="""" class=""attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image"" height=""675"" src=""https://coinstats.app/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Group-888-4.png"" width=""1200"" /></p><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every year, we're greeted by the unavoidable annual milestone - tax season! For those residing in tax haven countries, this is probably the last of your worries. However, for the rest of us, taxes are an unfortunate reality we must face sooner or later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it’s not all doom and gloom; you can save thousands of dollars on your crypto tax liabilities with strategic planning and the right tools. Here are some easy methods to help you reduce your tax bill this season:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>1. Take Advantage of the Long-Term Holding Period</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duration you hold onto your crypto can significantly impact your tax obligations. In many jurisdictions (e.g., USA, UK, Australia, etc.), holding onto your cryptocurrency for over a year before selling or exchanging your crypto may make you eligible for <strong>long-term capital gains tax rates</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Typically, these <strong>long-term rates are more favorable</strong> than short-term rates, which are applied to investments held for less than 12 months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, say you bought BTC on the 1st January 2023 and then sold it on the 1st September 2023 for a $100,000 profit. This would be considered short-term capital gains in the US (as it was sold after 10 months) and is therefore taxed at the federal income tax rate for this bracket which is 24%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NOTE: This calculation is based on the assumption that you have had no other income or short-term capital gains in the financial year period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, say you were to hold onto this BTC and instead sell it on the 1st February, 2024 - still for $100,000 profit. This would then be considered long-term capital gains (as it was sold after 13 months) and is taxed at a lower rate of 15%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>2. Harvest Your Losses</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tax-loss harvesting is another tactic that you can undertake to reduce your overall capital gains for the financial year period. This can be done by <strong>selling your crypto assets at a loss to offset your capital gains</strong>, slashing your overall tax bill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, say you purchase 1 BTC at $50,000. After holding onto it for a while, you decide to sell it when the value drops to $45,000 - incurring a capital loss of $5,000.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the same year, you also purchase 100 SOL for $4,000. The value of SOL triples, with your 100 SOL now worth $12,000. Consequently, you decide to take advantage of this price increase and sell all your SOL - leading to a capital gain of $8,000 ($12,000 - $4000).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this situation, you can offset your capital gains of $8,000 with your capital loss of $5,000. As a result, you are only liable for capital gains tax on the remaining $3,000, thereby reducing your tax burden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>3. Utilize Crypto Tax Calculator</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://cryptotaxcalculator.io/coinstats/"">Crypto Tax Calculator (CTC)</a><em> </em>simplifies and minimizes your taxes by<strong> automating the process of calculating your crypto tax liabilities</strong>. By importing your transaction data from various exchanges and wallets, the platform accurately determines your capital gains and losses, saving you valuable time and reducing errors that are prone to manual calculations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CTC also has a tax-loss harvesting tool, which highlights tokens &amp; NFTs you can sell to potentially minimize your tax burden and which ones you should hold onto in order to be eligible for the long-term CGT discount. The calculator also supports a variety of inventory methods which you can change based on your preferences (see our point 4).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In partnership with CoinStats, CTC is <strong>offering all users $30 off any plan</strong>! Sign up <a href=""https://cryptotaxcalculator.io/coinstats/"">here</a> and get your taxes sorted today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>4. Use the Most Tax Effective Inventory Method</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inventory methods refer to the way in which you match your cost bases with the sales of your crypto assets, which is particularly relevant in situations where you’ve bought the same cryptocurrency at multiple price points. This can significantly impact your capital gains calculations, which can lead to you overpaying on tax..</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Different countries also have different inventory methods (e.g., the UK has specific inventory methods set by HMRC), which you need to be aware of (see more on this<a href=""https://help.cryptotaxcalculator.io/en/articles/6201048-what-inventory-method-should-i-use""> here</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luckily for you, <a href=""https://cryptotaxcalculator.io/coinstats/"">Crypto Tax Calculator</a>’s <strong>most tax-effective inventory method</strong> will select acquisitions with higher prices as they will lead to larger losses or smaller gains. This inventory method also allows short-term gains to mature into long-term gains, leading to you paying less tax in the long run. This option can be found on the ‘Reports’ page in CTC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>5. Invest via a Retirement Fund</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, one of the most effective ways to save on taxes is by investing in crypto through your retirement fund. And while not all countries offer pension systems, those residing in jurisdictions such as the US, Canada, UK, Australia, etc… are typically enrolled into a retirement scheme.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contributions you make to your retirement fund are <strong>usually tax-deductible</strong>, allowing you to reduce your taxable income for the year. Plus, earnings from your investments in your pension fund (including gains from crypto) are <strong>often taxed at a lower rate</strong> than the standard capital gains tax rate, and in some cases, you can actually defer the taxes until you decide to withdraw your funds at retirement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can tell by now, reducing your crypto tax bill isn’t all that hard. All it takes is employing a few simple strategies like holding assets long-term, harvesting losses, and using tax-effective inventory methods. You may also opt to invest in crypto via your retirement fund to take advantage of the tax benefits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget to <strong>utilize tools like </strong><a href=""https://cryptotaxcalculator.io/coinstats/""><strong>Crypto Tax Calculator</strong></a> to streamline your tax calculations and maximize your tax savings. Take control of your crypto taxes today and start saving more of your hard-earned money!</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">What is an Exit Strategy?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An exit strategy is a plan for the sale of your crypto investment. It involves determining when to take profits or cut losses and what portion of your investments to sell upon reaching your price targets. The objective is to maximize returns while minimizing risk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A pre-set exit strategy helps avoid costly mistakes, allowing for rational, well-timed decisions that can potentially lead to profitable outcomes.<br /><br />CT shows a clear demand for such a tool:</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Market Timing</strong>: The crypto market is notoriously volatile, with rapid price fluctuations. An exit strategy helps in recognizing market peaks and taking profits before a potential downturn.</p>

<p><strong>Minimizing Losses</strong>: It's not just about profit maximization; an effective exit strategy also aims to minimize losses during unexpected market downturns.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Maximizing Profits</strong>: The strategy involves setting a target sale price slightly above your expectations, ensuring you don't exit too early and miss out on potential gains.</p>

Kraken confirms receiving Mt.

<p>At least one major centralized crypto exchange has confirmed receiving Bitcoin allocated for Mt. Gox creditor repayments.  Kraken announced it received undisclosed sums of Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) from Mt. Gox’s trustee, designated for user reimbursements. Emails sent to affected users and seen by crypto.news on Tuesday noted that Kraken plans to distribute crypto to creditor accounts within 14 days.  The confirmation arrived hours after the defunct BTC exchange transferred an estimated $6 billion in Bitcoin to unlabelled addresses.  According to Arkham Intelligence, the movements started with test transactions from a wallet tied to the bankrupt platform around 5:13 a.m. UTC. Between 6:39 a.m. UTC and 8:12 a.m. UTC, 47,229 BTC worth about $2.9 billion and 48,641 Bitcoin valued at $3.1 billion were transferred to separate addresses.  Mt. Gox saga mounts sell pressure on Bitcoin Several successful hacks battered Mt. Gox between 2011 and 2014, eventually leading to the platform’s bankruptcy declaration in February 2014. Criminals stole more than 950,000 BTC, which is currently worth over $60 billion.  Despite the large transfers, the defunct Bitcoin exchange still holds some $8.9 billion in BTC and is expected to settle around $9 billion of crypto creditor repayments.  Following Tuesday’s transactions, Bitcoin’s price declined to around $63,000 after trading above $65,000 on Monday. The drop was likely due to presumptive sell pressure expected over the next two weeks. At press time, Bitcoin showed strength and was seen edging back toward $64,000.  Source: https://crypto.news/kraken-confirms-receiving-mt-gox-creditor-bitcoin/</p>",BTC ETH News,"Kraken confirms receiving Mt.

<p>Following a slight crackdown from a range two weeks back, Ripple XRP saw a fast recovery and jumped consistently until the price broke above the range. It is looking highly bullish following a massive surge in volatility. Following past months of broader price correction, XRP appeared to have found solid ground above the $0.38 level as it saw a significant recovery over the past two weeks of trading. This period of recoveries has seen the asset through its most volatile buying session since last November with no signs of slowing down at the time of writing. Surging through several resistance levels in the past week, XRP broke out from a tight trading range and is currently back in an upward range, looking highly bullish on the daily timeframe. It is approaching April’s high but whether the price will break through is yet to be ascertained. A rejection under this high could trigger a retracement before picking up again. But if the price breaks higher, we can expect a massive liquidity run to the top before breaking out of the structure, which could set the market for more rallies in the future. Technically, the bears appeared to have lost control from a short-term perspective. Retaking the monthly low could bring them back into full action. XRP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview After passing through several resistance levels, XRP is still aiming for the $0.643 resistance level – marked as April’s high. If it reclaims this resistance, the next surge levels would be $0.7 (last December’s high) and March’s $0.744 high. For a retracement, the major support levels to watch for a bounce are $0.57, $0.53 and $0.478. A broader retracement could drag the price to $0.45, $0.419 and potentially back to the $0.383 level – the monthly low.

FBI details how USDT is laundered through Binance,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 17:24:06 +0000",https://bitcoinethereumnews.com/tech/fbi-details-how-usdt-is-laundered-through-binance/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=fbi-details-how-usdt-is-laundered-through-binance,"<p>The post <a href=""https://bitcoinethereumnews.com/tech/fbi-details-how-usdt-is-laundered-through-binance/"">FBI details how USDT is laundered through Binance</a> appeared on <a href=""https://bitcoinethereumnews.com"">BitcoinEthereumNews.com</a>.</p>
<p>Tether (USDT) is a convenient tool for romance and confidence scams due to its relative stability, speed, convertibility, and international transmissibility.

<p>Cardano (ADA) had an impressive start this month, rising over 25% and escaping the falling channel pattern. This significant rise boosted the demand surge, and the coin held on to the gains. Despite the significant rebound from the demand zone, the coin stuck around the 100-day EMA mark and attempted to rally beyond it. Unless the cluster of $0.4400 is not breached, a lack of buying activity could be seen. Above the $0.4550 mark, the confirmed uptrend could fuel a rally ahead, and the coin might reach its 38.2% Fib levels near the $0.4800 mark soon. ADA at Press Time At press time, ADA was trading at $0.4320 with an intraday surge of 0.36%, reflecting flat moves on the intraday chart. It has a monthly return ratio of -1.90% and 1.20% yearly, reflecting long consolidation. ADA/BTC was trading at 0.00000678 BTC with market cap at $16 Billion.

This surge highlighted renewed investor confidence and active buying interest in the market.

Also, the expected Ethereum ETFs will begin trading as early as July 23. This development has injected further optimism into the Ethereum market, fueling expectations for increased institutional participation and broader adoption. As a result of these announcements, Ethereum’s price climbed over 10% from the monthly low of $2,85 and currently holds a market cap of $420 billion, now commanding approximately 17.5% of the total cryptocurrency market share.

<p>I like to eat. What I mean by that is I like to make money. I’ve had my share of being hungry and eating two-minute noodles because I couldn’t afford anything else. That’s no fun, but it’s the reality for a lot of people in the Global South. It’s a reality that NoOnes plans to change. I want to make a lot of money, and I’m not ashamed to say so. Being really rich would be great, but it wouldn’t feel good if everyone around me was poor. It wouldn’t even feel good if they were moderately successful. The only way it would feel good is if everyone around me is rich, too. That’s the reason one of our values at NoOnes is “everyone eats,” and it’s so important I’ve made it part of our business model. There is hunger at NoOnes, but it’s a hunger to make sure we are doing everything we can to make sure everyone eats. It started with our pledge to give back 50% of the company’s profits. You can’t take that promise to the bank – because who’d trust them? – but you can look at my record and ask yourself if I’m serious about it. Ever since I joined the dots about the financial system and realized how it suppresses people who have no power, especially those in the Global South, I’ve made it my mission to help create a new system. There have been many roadblocks put in my way, but I’m positive we can create a new financial ecosystem, and that’s why I get up every morning. I’m making a choice, and I’m lucky enough to be able to make it because I have a skill-set that empowers me to get the job done.

That’s no fun, but it’s the reality for a lot of people in the Global South. It’s a reality that NoOnes plans to change. I want to make a lot of money, and I’m not ashamed to say so. Being really rich would be great, but it wouldn’t feel good if everyone around me was poor. It wouldn’t even feel good if they were moderately successful. The only way it would feel good is if everyone around me is rich, too. That’s the reason one of our values at NoOnes is “everyone eats,” and it’s so important I’ve made it part of our business model. There is hunger at NoOnes, but it’s a hunger to make sure we are doing everything we can to make sure everyone eats. It started with our pledge to give back 50% of the company’s profits. You can’t take that promise to the bank – because who’d trust them? – but you can look at my record and ask yourself if I’m serious about it. Ever since I joined the dots about the financial system and realized how it suppresses people who have no power, especially those in the Global South, I’ve made it my mission to help create a new system. There have been many roadblocks put in my way, but I’m positive we can create a new financial ecosystem, and that’s why I get up every morning. I’m making a choice, and I’m lucky enough to be able to make it because I have a skill-set that empowers me to get the job done. My vision of a Global South where&#8230; </p>",1

<p>Things are not looking good for Joe Biden since he fumbled in the debate against Donald Trump, a crypto supporter. Silicon Valley is home to some of the smartest brains on planet Earth who were among the early adopters of cryptocurrency. Still, due to Biden’s anti-crypto stance, a few leaders, including Elon Musk, have withdrawn support for the Democratic president.  The political landscape in the US, especially in the November POTUS elections, has left CEOs to make tough financial calls.

Staking and in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs can be reconsidered says SEC Commissioner,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 17:06:06 +0000",https://bitcoinethereumnews.com/crypto/staking-and-in-kind-redemptions-for-crypto-etfs-can-be-reconsidered-says-sec-commissioner/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=staking-and-in-kind-redemptions-for-crypto-etfs-can-be-reconsidered-says-sec-commissioner,"<p>The post <a href=""https://bitcoinethereumnews.com/crypto/staking-and-in-kind-redemptions-for-crypto-etfs-can-be-reconsidered-says-sec-commissioner/"">Staking and in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs can be reconsidered says SEC Commissioner</a> appeared on <a href=""https://bitcoinethereumnews.com"">BitcoinEthereumNews.com</a>.</p>
<p>SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s recent comments to Coinage Media have reignited discussions about the potential inclusion of staking and in-kind creation/redemption features in crypto ETFs. Peirce emphasized that these elements, which were excluded from initial ETF offerings, could be revisited in the future. Peirce stated, “I think certainly something like staking or any feature of the product that – we saw that on the Bitcoin ETPs too – there were features of the product that some people would have liked to see included but weren’t and those are always open for reconsideration as far as I’m concerned.” Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas noted that Peirce’s comments suggest these features might be reconsidered, particularly if the presidential administration changes. He included in-kind creations and redemptions, which allow ETF managers to exchange ETF shares for the underlying assets without triggering taxable events. For Bitcoin or other crypto ETFs, in-kind redemption could help maintain liquidity and minimize capital gains distributions.

<p>The crypto market stages a rally following reports that US presidential candidate Donald Trump has appointed a pro-crypto running mate.  JD Vance is reported to own between $100,001 and $250,000 in Bitcoin, underscoring Trump’s commitment to boosting the industry with crypto-friendly regulations.  2024 US presidential candidate Donald Trump selects US Sen. JD Vance as his running mate despite years of pointed criticisms targeted at him. Fascinatingly, his selection comes just two days after surviving an assassination attempt and on the first day of the Republican National Convention.  After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio. This development is reported to underscore Trump’s commitment to redefining the crypto industry with friendly regulations and making the US a centre of emerging technology. In investigating the background of Vance, CNF observed that he is a strong believer in crypto as he owns between $100,001 and $250,000 worth of BTC. One of his notable contributions to this space includes his relentless support for pro-crypto legislation since his election to the Senate in 2022. On top of that, he has been an active critic of Gary Gensler’s led US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), especially, its enforcement actions taken against the industry.  Vance is also known to have made a pro-crypto tweet in response to the reports that Canada’s finance minister is freezing Bank accounts of Canadians protesting COVID-19 vaccine mandates in 2022.  This is why crypto is taking off.

<p>Top crypto firms in the US are reportedly sending delegations to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week. Politico reports that officials from Coinbase, Ripple and the venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz plan to attend the event to promote a pro-crypto legislative and regulatory agenda. The same companies also reportedly plan to send representatives to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-South Dakota) tells Politico that crypto “clearly is an issue that more and more people are finding an interest in.” As the 2024 presidential campaign has heated up, the Republican Party and its presumptive nominee Donald Trump have increasingly courted the digital asset vote. Earlier this month, the Republican National Committee released a new party platform that promised to support crypto and oppose the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Former president Trump, who survived an assassination attempt over the weekend, has positioned himself as the crypto-friendly candidate despite previously painting digital assets as “a disaster waiting to happen.” His 2024 presidential campaign has also started accepting crypto donations, receiving $2 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) from Gemini crypto exchange co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss in June. In May, a jury found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts related to falsifying business records ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

<p>Unlike traditional stock markets, the cryptocurrency market operates 24/7 and often experiences price fluctuations on weekends. This summer, Bitfinex analysts noticed a trend that Bitcoin prices were increasing during these periods. Over the past month, Saturdays have seen an average return of 1.6% in Bitcoin price.

Bitfinex analysts stated that, in their view, “crypto asset prices in general in the current period are determined by the news agenda rather than fundamentals.” However, concerns about selling pressure have not completely disappeared. Mt. Gox creditors are scheduled to receive their Bitcoin payments within the next few weeks. Analysts expect these headlines to continue influencing the price before the situation is fully priced in. Last weekend, Bitcoin made a significant move, rising from $58,000 to $65,000 on Monday. This comes after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was assassinated at a rally in Pennsylvania. In recent months, the former president has shifted his tone to take a pro-crypto stance heading into the November elections.

According to DeFi^2, a significant portion of WLD holders are Korean retail investors, many of whom may not fully understand the risks due to language barriers. Moreover, the research suggests potential insider trading, with suspicious price movements occurring just before significant announcements.

<p>Metaplanet Inc., a Tokyo-based public company, has made headlines with its recent Bitcoin acquisition. This strategic move aligns with their ongoing Bitcoin for Treasury Asset Policy initiative. Experts view this purchase as a tactical decision to leverage current market conditions. Metaplanet Inc. boosts its Bitcoin holdings, signaling unwavering confidence in cryptocurrency as a valuable financial asset. Metaplanet’s Latest Bitcoin Acquisition: Strategic Timing In its latest financial maneuver, Metaplanet Inc. has procured an additional 21.88 BTC, valuing the transaction at 200 million yen (approximately $1.26 million). This acquisition is part of the company’s strategic effort to enhance its treasury assets with Bitcoin amidst fluctuating prices. By capitalizing on the current dip, Metaplanet aims to bolster its long-term investment portfolio. Bolstering Confidence Among Investors The recent purchase has not only expanded Metaplanet’s Bitcoin reserves to a commendable 225.6 BTC but also had an immediate positive impact on the company’s stock performance. Following the announcement, the company’s share price surged by 10% to ¥102 per share. This upward trajectory reflects growing investor confidence in Metaplanet’s proactive approach to digital currencies and asset diversification. Emerging Trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Market analysts note that Metaplanet’s continued investment in Bitcoin is emblematic of a broader trend among institutional investors. Other corporations are increasingly recognizing the potential of digital assets to diversify holdings and hedge against market volatility. This shift is evident as more small to mid-sized companies incorporate cryptocurrencies into their financial strategies, inspired by the successful outcomes seen with early adopters. Future Prospects for Institutional Involvement The implications of Metaplanet’s actions extend beyond the company’s immediate financial outlook.

<p>Ted Hisokawa Jul 16, 2024 12:47 CoinGecko&#8217;s Q2 2024 report reveals a 14.4% decline in the crypto market, with Bitcoin&#8217;s halving, mining hash rate drop, and trading volume shifts. The second quarter of 2024 saw significant shifts in the cryptocurrency landscape, according to CoinGecko&#8217;s latest report.

<p>This week, Solana SOL advanced bullishly after lifting from a base support some days back. While the bears are currently in disbelief of the latest move, they may suffer more losses if the price keeps surging daily. As Solana continued to show signs of strength daily, it recently broke above a key $155 resistance (now support) and now looks poise for a big move. The bulls are back in action with a steady surge in the past week. However, the price is reaching another crucial resistance line, which has been suppressing bullish actions since March. If the price respects this line, Sol may initiate another sell-off to the $122 level that has been producing support since it started to correct lower in the first quarter. As we can see, the bearish correction is suspended to bullish. A notable cross above this dynamic resistance line would activate a slight shift in the trend until it completely breaks out of the structure for a bigger rally. Now that the market is on a buying spree for a week, the bears are likely to suffer a huge loss in the bulls’ hands if they sustain momentum in the coming days. There are currently no signs of sellers in the market. If by any chance they find their way back, the market will resume its pending bearish sentiment in no time. SOL’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview As of now, the immediate parallel resistance for Sol is located at $175, after breaking slightly above the falling resistance line. The following resistance levels to watch are $189 and $204.5. In case of a drop, there’s a close support level at $155 that flipped as resistance on Monday. Below this support lies $146.2 and $137.

Grayscale has officially launched the Grayscale Decentralized AI Fund that will offer exposure to top cryptocurrencies in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector.

At around 23:00 UTC we were able to identify and <a href=""https://x.com/CoinStats/status/1804633869372559788"">share</a> the list of the affected wallets.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Upon further investigation, we discovered unauthorized access to parts of our infrastructure and third-party service providers, including HashiCorp Vault located in our infrastructure, which secured CoinStats Wallet 2FA keys(PINs) and a 3rd party wallet as a service provider APIs. Despite security protocols in place that segregated access controls and maintained any private keys outside of the control of CoinStats, through a combination of unauthorized intrusions across multiple services – including outside of CoinStats – the sophisticated (and we believe nation-state affiliated) attacker managed to access private keys of exactly 1590 CoinStats Wallets, resulting in the theft of approximately $2.2 million worth of cryptocurrency. The investigation into the full extent of the breach is ongoing.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Enhanced Exit Strategy&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We've given <a href=""https://coinstats.app/blog/exit-strategy/"">our exit strategy feature</a> a major overhaul. Now, you can set up detailed exit strategies with multiple exit prices directly from the initial coin list screen. This redesign not only integrates the exit prices but also allows for easier setup. To aid in precision, you can add or delete multiple rows, and our new autofill options suggest exit prices based on the latest market trends. Plus, a one-time hint and a price setting screen displaying current values ensure you're well-informed at every step.</p>

Smart Strategies: A Guide to Saving on Your Crypto Taxes,"Thu, 11 Apr 2024 12:38:35 +0000",https://coinstats.app/blog/crypto-tax-guide/,"<p><img alt="""" class=""attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image"" height=""675"" src=""https://coinstats.app/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Group-888-4.png"" width=""1200"" /></p><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every year, we're greeted by the unavoidable annual milestone - tax season! For those residing in tax haven countries, this is probably the last of your worries. However, for the rest of us, taxes are an unfortunate reality we must face sooner or later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it’s not all doom and gloom; you can save thousands of dollars on your crypto tax liabilities with strategic planning and the right tools. Here are some easy methods to help you reduce your tax bill this season:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>1. Take Advantage of the Long-Term Holding Period</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duration you hold onto your crypto can significantly impact your tax obligations. In many jurisdictions (e.g., USA, UK, Australia, etc.), holding onto your cryptocurrency for over a year before selling or exchanging your crypto may make you eligible for <strong>long-term capital gains tax rates</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Typically, these <strong>long-term rates are more favorable</strong> than short-term rates, which are applied to investments held for less than 12 months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, say you bought BTC on the 1st January 2023 and then sold it on the 1st September 2023 for a $100,000 profit. This would be considered short-term capital gains in the US (as it was sold after 10 months) and is therefore taxed at the federal income tax rate for this bracket which is 24%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NOTE: This calculation is based on the assumption that you have had no other income or short-term capital gains in the financial year period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, say you were to hold onto this BTC and instead sell it on the 1st February, 2024 - still for $100,000 profit. This would then be considered long-term capital gains (as it was sold after 13 months) and is taxed at a lower rate of 15%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>2. Harvest Your Losses</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tax-loss harvesting is another tactic that you can undertake to reduce your overall capital gains for the financial year period. This can be done by <strong>selling your crypto assets at a loss to offset your capital gains</strong>, slashing your overall tax bill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, say you purchase 1 BTC at $50,000. After holding onto it for a while, you decide to sell it when the value drops to $45,000 - incurring a capital loss of $5,000.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the same year, you also purchase 100 SOL for $4,000. The value of SOL triples, with your 100 SOL now worth $12,000. Consequently, you decide to take advantage of this price increase and sell all your SOL - leading to a capital gain of $8,000 ($12,000 - $4000).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this situation, you can offset your capital gains of $8,000 with your capital loss of $5,000. As a result, you are only liable for capital gains tax on the remaining $3,000, thereby reducing your tax burden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>3. Utilize Crypto Tax Calculator</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://cryptotaxcalculator.io/coinstats/"">Crypto Tax Calculator (CTC)</a><em> </em>simplifies and minimizes your taxes by<strong> automating the process of calculating your crypto tax liabilities</strong>. By importing your transaction data from various exchanges and wallets, the platform accurately determines your capital gains and losses, saving you valuable time and reducing errors that are prone to manual calculations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CTC also has a tax-loss harvesting tool, which highlights tokens &amp; NFTs you can sell to potentially minimize your tax burden and which ones you should hold onto in order to be eligible for the long-term CGT discount. The calculator also supports a variety of inventory methods which you can change based on your preferences (see our point 4).</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>4. Use the Most Tax Effective Inventory Method</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inventory methods refer to the way in which you match your cost bases with the sales of your crypto assets, which is particularly relevant in situations where you’ve bought the same cryptocurrency at multiple price points. This can significantly impact your capital gains calculations, which can lead to you overpaying on tax..</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Different countries also have different inventory methods (e.g., the UK has specific inventory methods set by HMRC), which you need to be aware of (see more on this<a href=""https://help.cryptotaxcalculator.io/en/articles/6201048-what-inventory-method-should-i-use""> here</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luckily for you, <a href=""https://cryptotaxcalculator.io/coinstats/"">Crypto Tax Calculator</a>’s <strong>most tax-effective inventory method</strong> will select acquisitions with higher prices as they will lead to larger losses or smaller gains. This inventory method also allows short-term gains to mature into long-term gains, leading to you paying less tax in the long run. This option can be found on the ‘Reports’ page in CTC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>5. Invest via a Retirement Fund</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, one of the most effective ways to save on taxes is by investing in crypto through your retirement fund. And while not all countries offer pension systems, those residing in jurisdictions such as the US, Canada, UK, Australia, etc… are typically enrolled into a retirement scheme.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contributions you make to your retirement fund are <strong>usually tax-deductible</strong>, allowing you to reduce your taxable income for the year. Plus, earnings from your investments in your pension fund (including gains from crypto) are <strong>often taxed at a lower rate</strong> than the standard capital gains tax rate, and in some cases, you can actually defer the taxes until you decide to withdraw your funds at retirement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can tell by now, reducing your crypto tax bill isn’t all that hard. All it takes is employing a few simple strategies like holding assets long-term, harvesting losses, and using tax-effective inventory methods. You may also opt to invest in crypto via your retirement fund to take advantage of the tax benefits.</p>

<p>Every year, we're greeted by the unavoidable annual milestone - tax season! For those residing in tax haven countries, this is probably the last of your worries. However, for the rest of us, taxes are an unfortunate reality we must face sooner or later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it’s not all doom and gloom; you can save thousands of dollars on your crypto tax liabilities with strategic planning and the right tools. Here are some easy methods to help you reduce your tax bill this season:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>1. Take Advantage of the Long-Term Holding Period</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duration you hold onto your crypto can significantly impact your tax obligations. In many jurisdictions (e.g., USA, UK, Australia, etc.), holding onto your cryptocurrency for over a year before selling or exchanging your crypto may make you eligible for <strong>long-term capital gains tax rates</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Typically, these <strong>long-term rates are more favorable</strong> than short-term rates, which are applied to investments held for less than 12 months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>For example, say you bought BTC on the 1st January 2023 and then sold it on the 1st September 2023 for a $100,000 profit.

<p>Cryptocurrency investing is dynamic and fast-paced, and having a clear plan for when to sell can make a significant difference.

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">What is an Exit Strategy?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An exit strategy is a plan for the sale of your crypto investment. It involves determining when to take profits or cut losses and what portion of your investments to sell upon reaching your price targets. The objective is to maximize returns while minimizing risk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having an exit strategy from the start is crucial. As humans, we are susceptible to emotional decision-making. A pre-set exit strategy helps avoid costly mistakes, allowing for rational, well-timed decisions that can potentially lead to profitable outcomes.<br /><br />CT shows a clear demand for such a tool:</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Why Do You Need a Crypto Exit Strategy?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Market Timing</strong>: The crypto market is notoriously volatile, with rapid price fluctuations. An exit strategy helps in recognizing market peaks and taking profits before a potential downturn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Minimizing Losses</strong>: It's not just about profit maximization; an effective exit strategy also aims to minimize losses during unexpected market downturns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Maximizing Profits</strong>: The strategy involves setting a target sale price slightly above your expectations, ensuring you don't exit too early and miss out on potential gains.</p>

<p>The OGs know that without a plan, you could fall for your emotions:</p>
