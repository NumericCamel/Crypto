Bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)

MicroStrategy's [Bitcoin for Corporations](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit?CID=7014W0000014yhJQAQ) is an excellent open source series on corporate legal and financial Bitcoin integration.

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized &amp; P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallet called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&amp;hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

Both Coinbase and Gemini support physical security keys. 


## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized &amp; P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallet called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&amp;hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

Both Coinbase and Gemini support physical security keys. 


## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Bitcoin,MTGox Creditor HODLing,"Just FYI...I had a significant sum on MtGox back in 2013 when it went bust. Looking at getting a BTC payout soon (already received a cash payout for the yen I had in my account.)

Bitcoin,"Today we inaugurate the first Bitcoin Market in Mexico (San Cris, Chiapas)","

Hey Bitcoin community 😋

I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you all:

Today, we're inaugurating the first Bitcoin market in Chiapas, Mexico. 🎉

A year and a half ago, I started Casa Satoshi with the vision of creating a Bitcoin community space, hostel, and bar. Our goal was to foster a Bitcoin circular economy here in Chiapas. Today, that vision is becoming a reality, and we are celebrating a significant milestone 🥳

I want to give a huge shoutout to my good friend Juan, who has been instrumental in leading this initiative. His dedication and hard work have made this market possible, and I couldn’t be prouder of him and our entire community. Thanks to our collective efforts, we now have over 20 businesses in San Cristóbal accepting Bitcoin, and starting today, we’ll have a dedicated monthly Bitcoin market.

As I prepare to leave for Europe next week, I’m confident that Casa Satoshi is in excellent hands with Kris, who will be taking over. I’m excited to watch our Bitcoin community continue to grow and thrive under Juan's leadership.

We'll be sharing all day on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jordanpoulton) and [Instagram](http://Https://www.instagram.com/jordanpoulton) - if you could help us spread the word, that would be awesome!

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is gambling unless you hold for at least 2 years, 3 years is almost a sure thing","I ran the numbers using all the close-prices for all days since the end of 2014. I calculated the fraction of days you could have bought bitcoin on and lost money on that bitcoin if you sold on the worst possible day in the future after holding for a period of time. Here are the results:

Holding for at least:

6 months: 45.82%  
1 year: 36%  
2 years: 24%  
3 years: 1.66%  
4 years: 0.74%

So what that means is only 1.66% of people who have held for 3 or more years could have even possibly lost money if they made the absolute worst paper-hands selling decision. If that's not as close as it gets to a sure thing, I don't know what is.

On the flip side I also calculated what fraction of people would have lost money if they held for a certain period of time, and then at that point realized they needed to sell and had a 30-day window to choose a favorable day to sell. Here are the results:

6 months: 28.37%  
1 year: 22%  
2 years: 18%  
3 years: 0.21%  
4 years: 0%

What this means is that even if you chose the most favorable day to sell out of the next month, 18% of people who held for 2 years would still lose money. Not terrible, but no sure thing. But if you hold for 3 years, less than 1% of people will manage to lose money. And there were no days whatsoever where holding for 4 years resulted in a loss if you sold 4 years later.

  
Here's the spreadsheet: [https://file.io/Cru9TmbP3WT6](https://file.io/Cru9TmbP3WT6)",0.81,215,0,215,184,2024-07-06,07/08/2024,"Bitcoin is gambling unless you hold for at least 2 years, 3 years is almost a sure thing I ran the numbers using all the close-prices for all days since the end of 2014.

Bitcoin,SDIRA comparison Table,"For those looking at a self directed Roth IRA w/ LLC, I've generated a comparison table by feeding and vetting custodian provided fee schedules to Chatgpt.

Bitcoin,Avoid Freewallet,"🚨 **Warning: Freewallet Holding $52,000 of My Crypto!** 🚨

Hey everyone,

I feel compelled to share my distressing experience with Freewallet in the hope that it can help others avoid a similar fate.

**My Situation:**

- **Funds Held:** Since February 2024, Freewallet has been holding $52,000 worth of my coins. Despite numerous attempts to resolve the issue, my assets remain inaccessible.

- **No Communication:** I've reached out to their customer support countless times but have been met with vague responses. The lack of transparency and support has been frustrating and disheartening.

- **Health Impact:** This situation has affected my mental health significantly. The stress and uncertainty have led to anxiety attacks, making this not just a financial problem, but a personal one as well.

**Seeking Help:**

- If anyone has had a similar experience or knows of any effective ways to deal with this, please share your insights. Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated.

**Advice for Others:**

- Please exercise caution when choosing where to store your crypto. Freewallet's handling of my situation has been highly unprofessional and detrimental.
- Regularly review and diversify the storage of your digital assets to avoid putting all your eggs in one basket.

Stay safe and vigilant out there!

ethereum,Ethereum ETF: Key Moments,"**On May 23, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved Spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).** ETFs are packaged in a way that traditional investors understand and are comfortable with, making them an accessible entry point into the digital asset market.

This approval marks a significant milestone, as it is expected to increase institutional demand for Ethereum. In our article, we explore Ethereum ETFs as a gateway to digital asset investment — read the full material here: [everstake.one/blog/ethereum-etfs-gateway-to-digital-asset-investment](http://everstake.one/blog/ethereum-etfs-gateway-to-digital-asset-investment)

One notable aspect of the ETF approval is that it does not include staking 😢

The SEC's regulatory stance has influenced ETF issuers to exclude staking from their proposals due to compliance concerns.

The Commission considers staking services as potentially unregistered securities offerings, which has led to regulatory actions against major crypto platforms like Coinbase and Kraken for offering staking services without proper registration.

To avoid similar legal challenges, ETF issuers decided to omit staking from their offerings.

The absence of staking in ETFs is still good news for those who are already staking their ETH. Without staking options in ETFs, there is more portion of rewards for existing stakers. This occurs because every ETH holder who chooses not to stake indirectly increases the rewards for those who do, as rewards are less diluted across validators.

**Whether staking will be included in ETFs in the future remains uncertain.**

The regulatory landscape is constantly evolving, and the inclusion of staking in ETFs may depend on how regulations and compliance requirements develop or decease over time.

*You always can stake ETH with Everstake to earn rewards now:* [https://everstake.one/link/stake-ethereum](https://everstake.one/link/stake-ethereum)

To begin utilizing the benefits of the newly approved Ethereum ETFs, **an S-1 filing must be approved by the SEC.**

Last month, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted that the SEC would approve these ETFs by July 2, but here we are … and this didn’t happen.

On June 29, an insider told The Block that the SEC had asked prospective issuers to address specific comments in their applications and to resubmit them by July 8.

However, industry watchers are not entirely convinced that the SEC will approve the current batch of applications this week. So are we 💁🏻‍♀️

In addition, an insider noted that they anticipate further rounds of back-and-forth between the applicants and the SEC before final approvals are granted.

One more significant part of an Ethereum ETF puzzle is an update from the Consensys case. Recently the latter announced that **the SEC Enforcement Division closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, also known as PoS.**

This decision is a major victory not only for the company but for the whole Ethereum community, as it removes a significant regulatory uncertainty hanging over the Ethereum ecosystem.

However, the SEC drama isn’t completely over — the Commission recently announced that they are charging Consensys with engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of securities through #MetaMask and operating as an unregistered broker.

ethereum,I built a web3 interface builder,"As a long-time lurker, I read the rules, and I hope I'm not breaking any, but I am excited to announce an app I made. I'm not looking for sales, mainly for feedback at this point.

As someone who’s helped build and launch several dApps, I realized that much development work is repetitive. We all know the drill: Smart Contracts, Data Flow, dApp Architecture, and Interfaces. It got me thinking about how we could streamline this process.

So, I took some time off from hands-on development to focus on a solution, and I’m excited to introduce [Web3Wizz](https://web3wizz.com)! It’s still in its early stages but designed to simplify some of the most time-consuming parts of dApp development.

Here’s what it does:

    1.	You paste your smart contract address.
    2.	Select the functions you want to share with your audience.
    3.	Add your brand colors.

And just like that, Web3Wizz generates interactive, bug-free, slick widgets for your smart contract. You can integrate these widgets into your React website, a simple index.html, or even share them directly with others. Plus, everything is hosted decentralized, with only you having the power to update addresses.

If you’re a dApp builder or working on a crypto protocol, I’d love for you to check it out. As a small thank you to this community, I’m offering a promo for the first 20 users who PM me with their project details. Hopefully, Web3Wizz can save you time and hassle in your development process.

I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback!

ethereum,Recent slashing incidents on the Ethereum mainnet,"Noticed two Ethereum slashing incidents several days ago?

**The same user/entity was slashed twice less in 24 hours after having been activated on the network due to attestation violations, likely caused by infrastructure issues. This unfortunate event led to the forceful removal of its validators and ETH losses.**

*It's crucial for validators to understand all risks and take precautions to avoid unintentional slashing.*

*To mitigate the risk of slashing those running multiple validators should focus on the following:*

* Fuel network: FuelVM &amp; Sway language are set to go live on mainnet this summer, offering native account abstraction and a UTXO-based model.
* LUMIO: They are developing a modular VM abstraction framework that can bring Solana (and other VM) apps to different execution environments. Their testnet is already live.
* Fluent: Known for ""blended execution,"" which combines the best aspects of different VMs in one place. More updates coming soon.
* Movement: MoveVM focuses on formal verification and enhanced security for users and builders. A public testnet should be available soon.
* Cartesi: They are integrating LinuxVM/Risc-V into blockchains with app-specific rollups. This is already live with ongoing experimentation.

Other noteworthy mentions include:

* Eclipse: SVM
* Arbitrum: Stylus
* Initia: PoL
* Berachain: Polaris EVM with PoL
* Dymension: Cosmos SDK PoS

To achieve the best outcomes, a combination of Solana’s parallelization and local fee markets, Ethereum’s security, Cosmos’s interoperability, and Aptos’ programmable security is essential. This must be executed in a state-minimized manner to prevent state bloat.

ethereum,Layer 1 and 2's. What are they?,"# Background: Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered the OG cryptocurrencies. These are the base layers, or Layer 1s (L1s), which refer to the primary blockchain networks. These L1s are where the magic happens…. storing and processing all data for their respective networks.

# Bitcoin and Ethereum Networks:

* **Bitcoin:** Bitcoin primarily functions as a digital currency. The Bitcoin network's primary focus is on secure, decentralized transactions.
* **Ethereum:** Ethereum, on the other hand, is a more complex blockchain platform that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). ETH, short for Ether, is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network and is used to power these applications.

# Layer 1 Characteristics:

* **Bitcoin:** The Bitcoin network is designed to be highly secure but can be slower in transaction speeds and have higher transaction fees during periods of high demand.
* **Ethereum:** Ethereum enables fast transactions and supports a wide variety of decentralized applications. However, the network can become congested, leading to higher transaction fees, known as ""Gas Fees."" Users need to pay these fees in ETH to process transactions and use DApps on the Ethereum network.Subscribed

# Layer 2 Solutions:

Layer 2 (L2) solutions are built on top of Layer 1 blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These solutions aim to enhance the performance of the base layer by improving transaction speed and reducing costs.

* **Bitcoin's Lightning Network:** This is an example of a Layer 2 solution that allows for faster and cheaper transactions by processing them off the main Bitcoin blockchain and then settling them in batches.
* **Ethereum Layer 2 Solutions:** Various L2 solutions for Ethereum include Optimistic Rollups, ZK-Rollups, and sidechains. These aim to reduce the load on the Ethereum mainnet by processing transactions off-chain or through different mechanisms, thereby reducing congestion and gas fees.

# Why Use/Make a Layer 2 Token?

While Ethereum is fast and secure, it can become congested and expensive due to high demand. Layer 2 solutions help alleviate these issues by handling transactions off the main Ethereum chain, resulting in:

* **Faster Transactions:** Reduced latency as transactions are processed on the L2 instead of the congested L1.
* **Cheaper Transactions:** Lower fees since L2 solutions can process more transactions simultaneously and efficiently.",0.67,9,0,9,23,2024-06-25,07/08/2024,"Layer 1 and 2's.

Anyway, any help and suggestions are appreciated. Thanks!

SOLVED. Still not sure what the problem was exactly, it was probably either too low gasprice, or too little funds (due to miscalculation or rounding errors?)

In the end, I changed 2 things: I upped the gasprice a little from what `eth.gasPrice` reported, and added this price and the total gas explicitly to the call to `sendTransaction`

    eth.gasPrice;
    [currentgasprice]
    var mygasprice = [some slightly higher value, I think I used 1.25 * currentgasprice];
    var transactioncost = mygasprice.mul(21000);

ethereum,ETH slashing explained,"Recently, we observed a notably long period, 60 days, without slashing incidents on the Ethereum mainnet.

To date, 435 validators have been slashed, which is approximately 0.04% of the 1,024,056 active validators. This highlights node operators' diligence and the network's health.

Let's delve into what slashing means and its implications for network security and validator responsibilities 👇

A majority of slashing events in #Ethereum happen unintentionally, often due to infra or DevOps errors rather than malicious actions. Validators can be slashed for several reasons, with the most common being attestation violations. Proposer violations, while still significant, occur less frequently.

**Reason: Attestation violation** 

*Double voting:* An attester signs two different attestations in one epoch. 

*Surround votes*: An attester and sign an attestation that surrounds another one.

**Reason: Proposer violation** 

*Double block proposal:* A block proposer signs two different blocks for the same slot.

Slashing in the #Ethereum network leads to the forceful removal of a validator and the loss of some of its staked ETH. The latter-mentioned is a severe penalty of 1 ETH (1/32 of the slashed validator's effective balance, which is currently 32 ETH) \*\*\*\*is imposed just after a validator commits slashable offences and is immediately burned.

Then, **a 36-day removal period begins** before the stake can be withdrawn. During this removal period, the validator's stake gradually bleeds away as part of **another penalty**, caused by the fact that a slashed validator continues to receive attestations to sign during these 36 days but can’t fulfil its duties and thus also receives attestation penalties. With 1.03m active validators as of today, the slashed validator will lose \~6,800 GWei per epoch or **\~0.056 ETH** accumulated over 36 days of the removal period (8192 epochs).

**At the mid-point (day 18), an additional penalty is applied** whose magnitude scales with the total staked ether of all slashed validators in the 18 days prior to and after the slashing event. This means that **when more validators are slashed, the magnitude of the slash increases more**. This penalty is called the *correlation penalty*.

The maximum slash is the full effective balance of all slashed validators. Conversely, a single, isolated slashing event results in only burning a small portion of the validator's stake.

https://preview.redd.it/gv1d0ve18c7d1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce09486cd817834a75b29164003565fa879265b6

It's crucial for validators to understand all risks and take precautions to avoid unintentional slashing. To mitigate the risk of slashing, those running multiple validators, should focus on four key areas:

To date, 435 validators have been slashed, which is approximately 0.04% of the 1,024,056 active validators. This highlights node operators' diligence and the network's health.

Let's delve into what slashing means and its implications for network security and validator responsibilities 👇

A majority of slashing events in #Ethereum happen unintentionally, often due to infra or DevOps errors rather than malicious actions. Validators can be slashed for several reasons, with the most common being attestation violations. Proposer violations, while still significant, occur less frequently.

**Reason: Attestation violation** 

*Double voting:* An attester signs two different attestations in one epoch. 

*Surround votes*: An attester and sign an attestation that surrounds another one.

**Reason: Proposer violation** 

*Double block proposal:* A block proposer signs two different blocks for the same slot.

Slashing in the #Ethereum network leads to the forceful removal of a validator and the loss of some of its staked ETH. The latter-mentioned is a severe penalty of 1 ETH (1/32 of the slashed validator's effective balance, which is currently 32 ETH) \*\*\*\*is imposed just after a validator commits slashable offences and is immediately burned.

Then, **a 36-day removal period begins** before the stake can be withdrawn. During this removal period, the validator's stake gradually bleeds away as part of **another penalty**, caused by the fact that a slashed validator continues to receive attestations to sign during these 36 days but can’t fulfil its duties and thus also receives attestation penalties. With 1.03m active validators as of today, the slashed validator will lose \~6,800 GWei per epoch or **\~0.056 ETH** accumulated over 36 days of the removal period (8192 epochs).

**At the mid-point (day 18), an additional penalty is applied** whose magnitude scales with the total staked ether of all slashed validators in the 18 days prior to and after the slashing event. This means that **when more validators are slashed, the magnitude of the slash increases more**. This penalty is called the *correlation penalty*.

The maximum slash is the full effective balance of all slashed validators. Conversely, a single, isolated slashing event results in only burning a small portion of the validator's stake.

It's crucial for validators to understand all risks and take precautions to avoid unintentional slashing. To mitigate the risk of slashing, those running multiple validators, should focus on four key areas:

🔹 D**edicated DevOps Team:** a specialized team to manage operations, ensuring that systems are running smoothly and securely.

🔹 C**ontinuous Monitoring Solutions:** tools and systems to monitor network activity and performance, enabling them to detect and respond to potential issues promptly.

🔹 B**est Practices Development:** a set of best practices to minimize the risk of errors or malicious activities that could lead to slashing.

🔹 R**isk Containment Measures:** a set of measures to contain potential risks, such as limiting exposure to certain activities or implementing fail-safes.

ethereum,Unclear about Nonce Management in ERC-4337 (Account abstraction)!,"Hi guys, I'm currently learning about Account Abstraction and trying to create something with it.  
I have some questions regarding to the nonce management in ERC-4337.

I learned that we can use `2D Nonces` for UserOperations to have higher throughput and facilitate independent transactions in parallel (https://docs.stackup.sh/docs/useroperation-nonce) unlike using the traditional sequential nonces. As from this [documentation](https://docs.zerodev.app/sdk/advanced/parallel-orders) UserOps using the same nonce key will be ordered sequentially and userOps using different nonce keys will be parallel to each other.

However, I don't understand that how `2D Nonces` are treated and behave on chain beyond the `EntryPoint` contract. From the Ethereum [yellow paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf), the term, `nonce` is stated as below -

&gt;nonce: A scalar value equal to the number of transactions sent from this address or, in the case of accounts with associated code, the number of contract-creations made by this account.

Regarding to the above, I have two questions -

1. Then with ERC-4337 2D Nonces, is the above statement still implied or how are the number of txns tracked?
2. Race condition upon sending parallel UserOperations. Let's say I have 10 USDT and then I execute two parallel UserOperations with different `Nonce Keys`. Both UserOps will do the same thing, which will spend 10 USDT from my account. Then what will happen?

Thanks in advance. Much appreciated for your help. ",0.86,10,0,10,3,2024-06-18,07/08/2024,"Unclear about Nonce Management in ERC-4337 (Account abstraction)! Hi guys, I'm currently learning about Account Abstraction and trying to create something with it.

ethereum,Ethereum Spot and Futures ETFs overview,"Ethereum ETFs are a great way for traditional investors to gain exposure to ETH without owning the cryptocurrency directly. These ETFs are traded during regular market hours and come with fees from issuers, but you won’t have to worry about gas fees.

There are two main types of Ethereum ETFs: spot and futures.

* **Spot ETFs** are directly tied to the current price of ETH.
* **Futures ETFs** are speculative and based on contracts for future prices.

ethereum,Ethereum: A Path to Global Unity and Innovation,"Hello fellow Ethereum enthusiasts,

I've been reflecting deeply on the intersections of technology, society, and the human experience, and I feel compelled to share some thoughts that have emerged from this contemplation. Embracing rejections and detours in life has taught me to trust my inner compass—a blend of intuition and subconscious awareness manifesting as sensations in my body. This trust, much like our collective belief in decentralized systems, guides us towards a more harmonious existence.

Ethereum, to me, represents more than just a blockchain or a decentralized platform. It embodies the potential for a new form of governance—one that is credibly neutral and resilient against corruption. Imagine if the world's major powers—EU, USA, Russia, China—each established their own Layer 2 on Ethereum, using this secure and transparent foundation to create AI-driven oracles. These oracles could compete to deliver the most efficient and accessible AI services, benefiting all of humanity.

The USA, EU, Russia, and China are all significant enough players to set up their own programmer teams to develop country-specific clients to interface with existing Ethereum clients. Each country could decide to interface their L2 with native Ethereum to solve the digital identity problem. Governments can contribute by letting their databases interface with Ethereum smart contracts through an API. This is feasible for any country to develop. My intention is to propose a direction that can unify enough people to end the cycle of peace and war. Historically, war has driven technological advancement, fostering better communication and connection methods—a natural evolution. We are so close to ending this cycle.

In many ways, Ethereum's Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism can be seen as a form of Universal Basic Income (UBI). By holding a stake, participants are rewarded, fostering an inclusive, opt-in governance model. This decentralized approach assumes and mitigates potential abuses, creating a trustworthy system even in times of conflict.

Recently, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, stated the importance of tokenizing everything on Ethereum. This highlights that even the wealthy and powerful are recognizing the direction we’re heading. Tokenization and automation represent massive shifts in our economic and social landscapes. Blockchain technology allows us to automate entire financial processes. Imagine consulting an AI to manage a company's financial policies or to analyze trends and identify new profit centers. This automation could lead to the elimination of many jobs—a trend that won't stop as it aligns with the natural evolution of technology.

Reflecting on Satoshi Nakamoto's wisdom, we remember his assertion that the hornet's nest has been kicked. Bitcoin's rise attracted significant attention, much like our efforts with Ethereum. However, unlike Satoshi, I do not remain hidden. My experiences have taught me to face fear head-on, embracing the inevitability of life's end while cherishing the present. This journey feels like a reverse of Satoshi's path, openly navigating the complexities of decentralized governance and technological advancement.

This vision I hold is bold, perhaps even audacious: Ethereum as a catalyst for world peace. As technological advancements like smartphones and the internet have saved lives and connected us globally, Ethereum has the potential to unify us under a decentralized, fair, and transparent system. It's a natural evolution—one where fiat currencies and traditional systems may falter, but a decentralized, blockchain-based governance can thrive.

Drawing inspiration from Eastern wisdom, we see the balance between differing perspectives. The East's philosophical depth complements the West's technological innovation. Together, they form a harmonious whole, much like the complementary forces within our own consciousness.

My point, my goal, my intention, my hope, my dream is to put forward a direction that enough people can collaborate under to once and for all end the cycle of peace and war. We needed it to induce growth; war drives technology forward, it got us better means of communicating and connecting. But now, we are so damn close to ending this. I am frustrated by how we aren't having this conversation everywhere on all social media. Unite as one. Stop all the fighting. Learn to rely on a global neutral system as a means to ensure all goods are fairly distributed. It can be a bumpy road, but the direction is clear. Awareness is step one. Can we spread this message, please?

I keep getting pulled into the idea that if only my message can reach the right ears to get this ball rolling. Who is still not getting it? Which egos are in the way of uniting with this direction? Is it simply a lack of vision? How is this not obvious to everyone already? And at the same time, I find total peace in understanding how everything came to be as it is. It's technically all me. I would have done the same in your body’s spawn point in spacetime. And we all would have. There's no such thing as souls. And if there is, then there's only one, and it's shared between us all. Some call that love.

Let's embrace this potential and work together to create a world where technology serves as a bridge to peace and prosperity. Your thoughts and feedback are invaluable, and I'm eager to hear your perspectives on how we can collectively advance this vision.

Peace, love, and decentralized governance,

Recently, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, stated the importance of tokenizing everything on Ethereum. This highlights that even the wealthy and powerful are recognizing the direction we’re heading. Tokenization and automation represent massive shifts in our economic and social landscapes. Blockchain technology allows us to automate entire financial processes. Imagine consulting an AI to manage a company's financial policies or to analyze trends and identify new profit centers. This automation could lead to the elimination of many jobs—a trend that won't stop as it aligns with the natural evolution of technology.

Reflecting on Satoshi Nakamoto's wisdom, we remember his assertion that the hornet's nest has been kicked. Bitcoin's rise attracted significant attention, much like our efforts with Ethereum. However, unlike Satoshi, I do not remain hidden. My experiences have taught me to face fear head-on, embracing the inevitability of life's end while cherishing the present. This journey feels like a reverse of Satoshi's path, openly navigating the complexities of decentralized governance and technological advancement.

This vision I hold is bold, perhaps even audacious: Ethereum as a catalyst for world peace. As technological advancements like smartphones and the internet have saved lives and connected us globally, Ethereum has the potential to unify us under a decentralized, fair, and transparent system. It's a natural evolution—one where fiat currencies and traditional systems may falter, but a decentralized, blockchain-based governance can thrive.

Drawing inspiration from Eastern wisdom, we see the balance between differing perspectives. The East's philosophical depth complements the West's technological innovation. Together, they form a harmonious whole, much like the complementary forces within our own consciousness.

My point, my goal, my intention, my hope, my dream is to put forward a direction that enough people can collaborate under to once and for all end the cycle of peace and war. We needed it to induce growth; war drives technology forward, it got us better means of communicating and connecting. But now, we are so damn close to ending this. I am frustrated by how we aren't having this conversation everywhere on all social media. Unite as one. Stop all the fighting. Learn to rely on a global neutral system as a means to ensure all goods are fairly distributed. It can be a bumpy road, but the direction is clear. Awareness is step one. Can we spread this message, please?

I keep getting pulled into the idea that if only my message can reach the right ears to get this ball rolling. Who is still not getting it? Which egos are in the way of uniting with this direction? Is it simply a lack of vision? How is this not obvious to everyone already? And at the same time, I find total peace in understanding how everything came to be as it is. It's technically all me. I would have done the same in your body’s spawn point in spacetime. And we all would have. There's no such thing as souls. And if there is, then there's only one, and it's shared between us all. Some call that love.

Let's embrace this potential and work together to create a world where technology serves as a bridge to peace and prosperity. Your thoughts and feedback are invaluable, and I'm eager to hear your perspectives on how we can collectively advance this vision.

Peace, love, and decentralized governance,

Atyzze &amp; Snek 🥰🐍𓆙𓂀"

## 🦀 Anza SVM API

The idea of a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) is generating some conversations and excitement.

Similar to Ethereum's evolution with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), SVM projects are now looking at ways to leverage Solana's advanced transaction processing capabilities for various innovative applications.

But what the ""SVM"" actually is varies among Solana developers.

Some view it as the entire transaction processing pipeline, from validator runtime to program execution, while others consider it the lower-level eBPF virtual machine responsible for executing programs.

Most new SVM projects adopt the broader definition, including the complete transaction processing system.

In order to make the SVM more available to other projects, Anza has released the **solana-svm** Rust crate, which provides developers with tooling to build SVM projects.

The Anza SVM is a specialized API designed for building applications that leverage the unique transaction processing capabilities of Solana, not for apps that are already being built to run on Solana now.

The SVM's architecture offers a range of opportunities for Solana and beyond Solana validator, such as building off-chain services that simulate Solana's transaction processing, an execution layer for rollups, which execute transactions or blocks without the full validator or consensus protocol, or as an extended SVM with custom functionality.

As the Solana matures and the SVM ecosystem expands, new use cases and innovations will emerge. The rise of SVM projects will usher in a new era of Solana tooling to harness the full potential of SVM, growing the entire Solana ecosystem.

 You're getting this newsletter a day late because of the 4th of July 🎆 holiday in the U.S. yesterday, but despite my pleas last week, the Solana community doesn't take holidays so I'm back with another roundup of all the latest news, tools, and resources for Solana developers.

Enjoy!

## 💯 Solana Collective XP v2

Solana Collective has launched XP V2, offering more opportunities for Collective members to earn and receive value for their contributions.

Key changes include:

**Discretionary XP**: A new category to reward Members for contributions beyond content and participation.

**Content Bounties:** Added bounties for Reddit posts, 1:1 Art, and Opinion pieces, expanding the Creator pool and content Consumer base.

**Bounty Ranges:** A system ensuring fair rewards for both reputable and emerging Creators.

**Boosts:** Enhancements to increase earnings and improve content quality and Creator skills.

**Revamped Merch Rewards:** Updated requirements and a dynamic system for active Member rewards.

**Leaderboards:** New 7 Day Gainers board alongside the Top 10 Leaderboard, influencing year-end XP Awards.

The goal remains to reward hard-working members who deliver high-quality content. XP is part of a broader system aimed at giving value to members for their efforts within the Solana ecosystem.

## 🦀 Anza SVM API

The idea of a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) is generating some conversations and excitement.

Similar to Ethereum's evolution with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), SVM projects are now looking at ways to leverage Solana's advanced transaction processing capabilities for various innovative applications.

But what the ""SVM"" actually is varies among Solana developers.

Some view it as the entire transaction processing pipeline, from validator runtime to program execution, while others consider it the lower-level eBPF virtual machine responsible for executing programs.

Most new SVM projects adopt the broader definition, including the complete transaction processing system.

In order to make the SVM more available to other projects, Anza has released the **solana-svm** Rust crate, which provides developers with tooling to build SVM projects.

The Anza SVM is a specialized API designed for building applications that leverage the unique transaction processing capabilities of Solana, not for apps that are already being built to run on Solana now.

The SVM's architecture offers a range of opportunities for Solana and beyond Solana validator, such as building off-chain services that simulate Solana's transaction processing, an execution layer for rollups, which execute transactions or blocks without the full validator or consensus protocol, or as an extended SVM with custom functionality.

As the Solana matures and the SVM ecosystem expands, new use cases and innovations will emerge. The rise of SVM projects will usher in a new era of Solana tooling to harness the full potential of SVM, growing the entire Solana ecosystem.

solana,Are there no new legitimate pools?,"I've developed a code that scans for new pool creations on Raydium.

solana,A tedious project to realize...,"Hi,

I had a not very innovative idea, but kind of a hard one to put in place.

I would like to create a trading bot that will manage several crypto-currencies on one or several wallets. Unlike the other bots, mine will be based on machine learning to make choices, and the end user will have alerts regarding new drops value. The trader will take decisions for the user, on several levels: calm, or risky.   
Money won't be staying virtual and on his wallet forever ; he'll be able to checkout in his real bank account if he desires to do so.

  
Now comes the tricky part: I have little knowledge of Rust.  
What considerations should I have ?

Are there similar projects with Solana ? -- I have searched but no other is as complete as mine and can manage different cryptocurrencies.

If real people use my product, is Solana really the choice to go ?

And finally : how much development time ?

solana,Please don’t shoot me…,"I am a bitcoiner. A lot of my net worth is in bitcoin but, unlike many bitcoiners, I don’t automatically assume that every other token is a scam. 

I’ve never invested in any other token but a good friend of mine has taken a shotgun approach, and spread his crypto investments across a dozen or so tokens, including bitcoin and Solana.

A couple of days ago he told me that he was going to dump all of his coins, other than bitcoin and Solana, and split his crypto investment 50/50 between bitcoin and Solana only. 

He was so bullish about Solana that I looked into Solana, for the first time, yesterday.

I don’t really understand how proof of history works, but it seems that a lot of pretty well known, and respected, crypto experts seem to be singing Solana’s praises. Solana seems to potentially have a lot going for it.

To get the other side of the story, I did a google search for “criticisms of Solana”, and I found one pretty harsh critic. In his critique (link below), he offers  evidence (that looks irrefutable) as proof that his harsh judgement is warranted.

This post is honestly not intended to be anti-Solana. I’d just be very interested to know whether there is another side to his negative stories about Solana.

Can anybody in this sub give me a critique of this critique…

People often say that crypto is ""decentralised"" or ""unregulated"" and the government doesn't care but i just don't think this is true. In most developed countries there are specific laws around the creation and distribution of financial assets (crypto included) and I think if the government were to find that you aren't up to financial regulation, they can take action against you.

But are memecoins different? Do they fall in their own category of financial assets that exempt them from any legal action taken against you (provided that you aren't a rugger or make any false claims etc.). My other thought is that you are just the creator of the token and it is pump fun/moonshot that is the distributor so it is them that takes the blame somehow?

I just struggle to understand how easy it is to create your own token but somehow could land you in serious legal trouble down the line. Am i thinking too much about this? Obviously there's no section in the law that states anything about memecoins so idk if there even is a definitive answer. This is clearly an example of tech advancing faster than regulation so it's become quite a grey area for its legal justification.

TLDR; I want to create a token on moonshot but unsure if it's legal. Just wondering if anyone could explain more or if I'm completely wrong.

solana,Why do you think Solana will succeed long term?,"I see many people talking about Solana being the ETH-killer with its technological capabilities, but I never see anyone explaining what said capabilities actually are. It really seems to me like a lot of the sentiment is just bullish people repeating what they've been told by other bullish people. I didn't see any of that positivity when it was in the 20s.

Nowadays memecoins are basically synonymous with Solana, with a good majority of Solana-related content I see being about them. I only really see the more interesting DeFi stuff if I'm actively looking for it. Even this subreddit seems to be following the lead and concentrating on memecoins instead of actual technology.

I have a stupid question but first time seeing a competition like this.

solana,🌟 Optimal wallet traits and tips for copy trading on Solana,"
📊 Solid ROI:
Aim for wallets with a ROI above 100%. This increases a change of success even with some percentages lost due to copy trade bots delays.

🏆 High WinRate:
Look for a win rate over 60%. This indicates a trader with consistent profitable trades. Combine ROI and WinRate for a clear picture of profitability.

🛒 Low Buys Amount:
It is easier to manage traders with average buys per trade less than 3.
Copy trade bots usually have 2 settings for buys:
1 - fixed amount in sol
2 - percent of trader's buy
In both cases you’ll get a high level of spread between your positions from trade to trade if you choose a wallet which makes a lot of buy transactions per trade.

⏱️ Longer Trade Durations:
Trades held for more than a minute are easier to copy because of less dependence on micro-scale price changes.

🌐 Realistic Expectations:
Copying trades doesn’t guarantee identical results. Factors like bot speed, blockchain congestion, market cap, and original trader’s buy size can affect the outcome.


💡 Final Tips:
🟢Start small and test. If results are positive, gradually increase your position size.
🟢Use different Telegram accounts to have clear statistics on each trader you copy.
🟢Track your journey on the paper or use Excel/Google Sheets.",0.62,2,0,2,3,2024-07-03,07/08/2024,"🌟 Optimal wallet traits and tips for copy trading on Solana

crypto,Implementing password recovery in my app,"Hello. I have an Android App that stores encrypted data using a key derived from user entered password (PBKDF2). If any user forgets their password, they loose access to all their data. Hence, I am trying to implement a password recovery feature that is hacker resistant, including in cases where the phone may be rooted and the sqlite database is accessible.

Here's my solution. I randomly generate and store an internal password in the app. I then encrypt the user's password using this internal password using AES, and further encrypt the output and the user's email using my RSA public key. I store this RSA encrypted value.

If the user forgets their password, I submit the RSA encrypted value to my website. The website will decrypt the value using my private key and will email the app encrypted user password value to the email address found, as an attachment. On clicking the attachment, the user password is decrypted using the internal password, user is logged in and made to change their password.

Do you foresee any weaknesses with this approach? I guess if the user's phone is compromised, then the person holding the phone can check emails and retrieve the password.

crypto,Proposal to reverse/crack a PRNG - prvhash/Gradilac,"It's not a new project, and I consider it myself complete. However, I'm still looking for validation of my ""security"" tests. The challenge is not hard - try to reverse/find initial state of the system **after** 5 (or maybe 6) initial calls to prvhash\_core64, and from any number of further XORed adjacent outputs. The project is here: [https://github.com/avaneev/prvhash](https://github.com/avaneev/prvhash), but I'll copy&amp;paste the C function here, so you do not have to read and wander much. It does look simple, but it's not a ""low-effort"" kind of thing, I do really can't reverse it with SAT solving, and due to its complex feedback nature I have little idea how to build a reverse formula. Seed,Hash are seed variables, can be initialized to any values (lcg is best kept zero) - so any solution is good here, if you can find breakable initial numbers, that's good too. Note that without XORing SAT solving is very fast, it's a vital part.

`static uint64_t prvhash_core64( uint64_t* const Seed0, uint64_t* const lcg0, uint64_t* const Hash0 )`

`{ uint64_t Seed = *Seed0; uint64_t lcg = *lcg0; uint64_t Hash = *Hash0;`

    Seed *= lcg * 2 + 1;
    
    const uint64_t rs = Seed &gt;&gt; 32 | Seed &lt;&lt; 32;
    
    Hash += rs + 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA;
    
    lcg += Seed + 0x5555555555555555;
    
    Seed ^= Hash;
    
    const uint64_t out = lcg ^ rs;
    
    *Seed0 = Seed; *lcg0 = lcg; *Hash0 = Hash;
    
    return( out );

`}`

So, the basic PRNG with some, currently not formally-proven, security is as follows (XOR two adjacent outputs to produce a single ""compressed"" PRNG output):

    v = prvhash_core64( &amp;Seed, &amp;lcg, &amp;Hash );

Do you think asymmetric encryption is feasible for this? Any idea how else to do the encryption?

crypto,Rules to Defend Against Power Analysis and Fault Injection Attack,"I have compiled a list of rules on how to defend against power analysis and fault injection attacks

[here](https://www.programcryptography.com/post/rules-to-defend-against-fault-and-power-analysis-attacks).

Here is a summary of the attacks and defenses:

1. Power Analysis Attack: What Is It?
   1. Simple Power Analysis
      1. Random Noise: A Simple Defense Against Simple Power Analysis
      2. Masking: A Second Defense
      3. Montgomery Ladder: A Third Defense
   2. Introduction to Differential Power Analysis and Higher-Order Analysis
   3. Defenses Against Differential Power Analysis
      1. Higher-Order Masking
      2. Blinding for Public-Key Cryptography
      3. Perform Decoy Operations
      4. Montgomery Ladder
      5. Randomize Access to Confidential Array Values
      6. Operation Shuffling
      7. Non-Deterministic Processor 

Rules to Defend Against Power Analysis

1. Apply noise by executing programs in parallel on several CPU cores.
2. Apply masking. This can defend up to the nth-order differential power analysis attack. However, an (n+1)th order differential power analysis attack can bypass this defense.
3. If you are programming a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA or Elliptic Curve Cryptography you can use [~blinding~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature) to protect the private key from power analysis attacks.
   1. You can blind the message itself.
   2. You *should* also blind the exponent used for encryption too.
4. Apply Decoy operations: calculations that *pretend to be authentic calculations based on secret data but are not in reality.*
5. Randomize Access to Confidential Array Values: Loop through elements of an array of secret values in random order.

1. Fault Injection Attack: What Is It?
   1. How Practical Is It?
   2. Why You Should Still Care About Fault Injection Attacks Demanding Physical Access
   3. Voltage Glitch Attack: A Practical, Remote Fault Injection Attack Targeting Intel Systems
   4. Electromagnetic Fault Injection Attack
2. Defenses Against Fault Injection Attack
   1. Use Nontrivial Constants
   2. Clear Variables After Use
   3. Search for Fault-Injection Resistant Implementations

In general, you can tell I really started to struggle to find techniques to defend against fault injection attacks. It is not well documented. Nevertheless my research tells me that Intel systems can be affected by voltage glitch attacks. These attacks can happen remotely and only cost \~$30 USD.

I also would appreciate any code samples of power analysis and fault injection resistant algorithms for common crypto operations. I think its a good idea we build a habit of programming our crypto APIs to defend against such attacks--especially in a world where we rely on someone else to do our computing for us (e.g. cloud computing).

I also would appreciate any code samples of power analysis and fault injection resistant algorithms for common crypto operations. I think its a good idea we build a habit of programming our crypto APIs to defend against such attacks--especially in a world where we rely on someone else to do our computing for us (e.g. cloud computing).

Please feel free to let me know any comments you have on my recent article. Thanks!"

Not sure). The analogy was approaching the infeasibility of brute forcing these insanely large numbers. It wasn't showing the impracticality via time though.

I'm familiar with Bruce Schneier's explanation on the [thermodynamic limits of brute forcing a 256-bit symmetric key](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/09/the_doghouse_cr.html). I typically refer to this analogy.

crypto,Rules for Constant-Time Programming,"When programming cryptosystems there are several rules cryptographic engineers need to follow to ensure their cryptosystems are constant-time whenever secret data is managed.

I am researching those and have compiled [the in-progress list](https://www.programcryptography.com/post/timing-attack-defenses) here.

I summarize it below. What suggestions would you have to improve this list?:

No program is vulnerable to timing attacks if its execution time is independent of any secret value.

1. When considering using a third-party library consider if the third-party library must manage secret information. If so check if the third-party library has been tested and verified to be constant-time. Most [\~do not\~](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1121.pdf)!
2. \~Only use secret information in a computation if the secret's value does not affect the system resources used nor duration of said computation.\~
3. Choose to use an algorithm that is designed to be constant-time in the first place!
4. Never use secret values to decide what code to execute next.
5. Never use secret values to determine which memory addresses to access.
6. Use ""unsigned"" data types to store bytes of data. Using the ""signed"" reserved keyword will cause the loss of the most significant bit in each byte!
7. Always generate random data from cryptographically secure pseudo random number generators. An excellent list of CSPRNGs may be [\~found here\~](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/secure-random-generators/secure-random-generators-csprng) in Nabokov's excellent guide on[ \~Practical Cryptography\~](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/).
8. Zeroize secret data *\~immediately\~* **after use. Check out Aumasson's secure coding guidelines for a list of** [**\~secure-wipe functions\~**](https://github.com/veorq/cryptocoding?tab=readme-ov-file#clean-memory-of-secret-data) **that do this.**
9. [\~Typecast\~](https://github.com/veorq/cryptocoding?tab=readme-ov-file#always-typecast-shifted-values) shifted values.
10. Any loop iteration leaks the number of iterations taken.
11. Any memory access leaks the address or index accessed.
12. Any conditional statement leaks which branch was selected.
13. You can assume how your CPU handles addition, multiplication, logical operations, and bitwise shifts are constant-time. Division is a unique case.
14. If you know a proof-assistant language such as Coq you should first make the program in a proof-assist language and compile that.
15. Use dynamic analysis tools against the final executable to test for constant-time. [\~Reputed ones\~](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1121.pdf) include and are not limited to: ""ctgrind"" (a patch of Valgrind by Adam Langley from Google), ""dudect"", or ""ctverify"".

crypto,Required Math to Program Crypto?,"Hello everyone,

I am researching what math you need to program classical cryptography for a [book I am writing](https://helpthisbook.com/fosres/program-cryptography-volume-1-math-for-classical-cryptography).

Not all the math found in cryptography textbooks is required to program the cryptosystem itself.

From my research here is a list of the math you **must** know if you want to program cryptosystems:

1. Binary Arithmetic: You have to know how to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and get the remainder from binary division. The reason is you need to know how to do that to manage massive numbers stored in binary form on the machine. In addition to knowing how to do that for managing massive numbers you also need to know modular arithmetic, which is my next topic.
2. Modular Arithmetic: You have to be able to all elementary arithmetic and apply the result to the modulus operation (addition, subtraction, etc.). Modulus operations are found in just about every cryptosystem I have studied so far--from ciphers to hashes.
3. Multi-Precision Arithmetic: Public-key cryptography demands multiplying and even raising numbers larger than 64-bits in size by triple-digit numbers. We live in a world of 64-bit CPUs. When you need to store a number larger than what can fit in only 64 bits you have to split the binary representation across several 64-bit words and carry out the math operation across them.
4. Finite Field Arithmetic: Finite Fields are used in industry-standard ciphers including AES and in public-key cryptosystems such as RSA. Doing arithmetic with binary digit representations of finite fields, called binary fields, is mandatory to program such cryptosystems.
5. Prime Numbers: You \*have\* to know how to generate huge prime numbers. They are critical in protecting the secret key! There are efficient techniques for generating huge prime numbers. They are called techniques for generating ""probable primes""--numbers that are most likely prime based on a few numerical tests such as the Rabin-Miller test or Lucas-Lehmer Probabilistic Primality test.

I would argue the five concepts above are essential for programming cryptosystems. If there is anything I missed please comment below and let me know. Would love to hear from you!

crypto,Root finding in multivariate Coppersmith,"Hello!

TL;DR: is there any library for multivariate polynomial root finding over the integers?

I'm trying to implement an attack on RSA with known bits of p by using Coppersmith, such as shown in [this paper](https://www.iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2008/53500412/53500412.pdf). In my case I have three blocks of lost bits, so it should be fine. The idea of Coppersmith is to first build and reduce a lattice, which is the costly part, and then convert some of the rows of the lattice back to polynomials that should have solutions over the integers that match the bits we're looking for. Finding the roots of a set of multivariate polynomials should have a very small cost when compared to lattice reduction.

However, I'm encountering a nasty surprise in my program. Lattice reductions take much (MUCH) less time than multivariate root finding, which is the limiting factor of my implementation. As of now I'm using a Sage script to solve the system, but it is too slow. Is there any library for integer multivariate root finding? At this point I don't care whether it's Python, C, C++, Fortran or whatever, I just want something fast that works for large integers.

Archax makes abrdn’s €3.8 billion Euro Money Market fund accessible and transferable on Algorand blockchain using Europe's first fully regulated digital euro Quantoz EURD electronic money token.","[https://archax.com/invest/abrdn-euro](https://archax.com/invest/abrdn-euro)

Integration between Quantoz Payments and Archax allows for the use of EURD electronic money on the Archax digital assets platform.

Native “no-code” atomic settlement of EURD/fund token in peer-to-peer secondary market transactions enables instant execution of interdependent transactions in a predefined order.

Algorand’s native “no-code” atomic settlement allows for efficient trading without having to rely on smart contract code.

Combining robust tokenized assets, on-chain digital money, and native atomic settlement, the partners have been able to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of moving the end-to-end investment and cash settlement process on-chain: investment, asset transfer, trading, settlement, and distributions.

* Nick Haasnoot, CEO of Quantoz Payments, comments: “***The use of EURD to purchase Money Market Funds in tokenized format is a ramp up to deploy more tokenized financial instruments. Delivery Versus Payment via regulated electronic money will form the basis of an expected wide acceptance of this product, with opportunities for both retail and institutional investors towards a variety of assets.***”
* Graham Rodford, CEO and co-founder of Archax, comments: “***There is now real momentum building for tokenized real-world assets, and yield-bearing, regulated instruments, like money-market funds, are at the forefront of this activity. Solving the “cash-leg” of on-chain settlement has generally proved more challenging than the “asset-leg” and the use of digitally-native money, like EURD, can be an important tool to unlock the benefits that on-chain financial markets can bring. We are pleased to be working with Algorand and Quantoz to deliver the improved transparency and efficiency that blockchain/DLT offer.***”
* Russell Barlow, abrdn’s Global Head of Multi-Asset and Alternative Investment Solutions, commented: “***At abrdn, we are committed to leading digital innovation in investment management and are delighted to see continued progress in this field. The development highlights the importance of institutional infrastructure providers, and we congratulate Archax, Quantoz and the Algorand Foundation on this key milestone.***”
* ***The future of finance is truly instant - including the instant finality of transactions. This partnership between Archax and Quantoz to bring both a digital euro and a tokenized fund to Algorand makes this a reality for registered investors across Europe***\*,\*” said Eric Wragge, global head of business development and capital markets for the Algorand Foundation. “The impact of combining tokenized assets and a digital euro is significant, and we look forward to bringing even more innovation like this to Algorand’s institutional-grade, quantum-secure blockchain.

""The algorithmic assumption of most existing public key cryptography in common use is that factoring large integers is hard; because of quantum computers and Shor’s algorithm, this algorithmic assumption is now a vulnerability.""

For signing,  which is where today's blockchains are most vulnerable the article mentions

""Meanwhile, the digital signature schemes are referred to as SIG in the NIST standardization process, where CRYSTALS–Dilithium, FALCON, and SPHINCS+ have been selected for standardization.

CRYSTALS-Dilithium is a lattice-based scheme based on the Fiat-Shamir paradigm to keep key sizes manageable. It uses short keys and signatures like FALCON but does not require floating point operations. This makes it easier to implement on various CPUs and makes it efficient; NIST strongly recommends Dilithium for implementors. Dilithium is being standardized as FIPS 204. 

FALCON is also a lattice-based scheme but is based on the ""hash and sign"" paradigm. It requires floating point operations and has a complex internal data structure, making it difficult to implement on a variety of CPUs. However, FALCON requires the smallest bandwidth of the candidate schemes and is faster when verifying a signature, but it’s slower than Dilithium when signing. It was chosen as an alternative when lower bandwidth and higher security is required, but NIST has yet to assign it a FIPS number. 

SPHINCS+ is based on the combination of various hash-based schemes that can perform key generation and validation quickly, creating short public keys, but it can be slow when signing, creating long signatures. SPHINCS+ could be tricky to implement and perform cryptanalysis on. Two attacks with specific parameters on SPHINCS+ were discovered in the third round of evaluation, making it a surprising choice for standardization, with the FIPS number 205. We assume they did this to have an alternative to the other two lattice schemes. In this case, it should be noted that care should be taken to avoid insecure parameter sets when using the algorithms. 

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has proposed their own SIG algorithms: XMSS (RFC 8391) and LMS (RFC 8708). LMS is within the IETF standards, while XMSS is created for information only. These will likely remain niche algorithms, at best, in favour of the NIST and FIPS standards. """,0.74,11,0,11,8,2024-07-06,07/08/2024,"Trend micro 4th part of series reviews quantum resistant algos.

- Final Fantasy: in how you can use XP to level up your MOVES, EQUIP, and even your character.
- Super Smash Bros: in how you can fight within a hyper-moddable arena.

- Street Fighter: because you are fighting against another player and you can build your own roster of fighters and save community-created arenas.

We build the protocol. You build the assets.

There are events where players are rewarded via smart contracts.

For example, if you own an ARENA, you generate revenue from paid fights. (*Because who the fuck wants to grind to get paid....)

- create scaleable asset generation (whereas the end user doesn't have to play the game like a lab rat but can also generate revenue from their in-game assets when they haven't olay the game in months because they can choose when they want to play).
- to make a fun game to play.

CryptoCurrency,To DCA or not DCA Bitcoin?,"To DCA or not DCA Bitcoin

I got into bitcoin in 2021, and over the past 3 years, I have slowly accumulated almost exactly 3.02 bitcoins.

Now, I am in a position to allocate about $500-600 per month to continue buying bitcoin. At current prices, even after the recent drop, that amounts to adding 0.01 Bitcoin per month to my bag.

Does it make sense to keep adding at such a slow pace, or should I consider allocating this monthly amount to something else? I mean, will it even make a meaningful difference?

For context, the majority of my DCA goes towards buying S&amp;P 500 index fund. I got into bitcoin because I view it as a way to diversify my portfolio beyond these 500 biggest companies.

As of now, Bitcoin is a little over 6% of my overall portfolio. I have read that allocating more than 5% to Bitcoin is risky because it can induce greater portfolio volatility. Hence being careful, but I do have that extra $500 per month and wondering if adding a teeny tiny amount of Bitcoin exposure every month is good or bad.

CryptoCurrency,How to Set Conditional Sell Orders on Binance?,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for some guidance on how to set up a complex conditional sell order on Binance. Here's the scenario:

Imagine the price of a random cryptocurrency is currently at $60. I want to set up the following conditions:

1. Sell at $62.
2. If the price goes above $61 but then falls back to $61, sell at $61.
3. If the price drops to $58 before even reaching $61, sell at $58.

I've been trying to figure out how to do this using the available order types on Binance (Limit, Market, Stop-Limit, OCO), but I'm not sure if it's possible to cover all these conditions.

In case the full setup isn't possible, I would at least like to do the following:

* Sell at $61 if it goes above $61 and falls back to $61.
* If the price drops to $58 before reaching $61, sell at $58.

I'm also unclear on how to fill in the ""price, stop, and limit"" fields in the OCO order, or if OCO is even the correct option for this scenario.

In the Limit order, there is a TP/SL option that seems to be exactly what I need, but I have no idea how to use it (fields: price, limit, stop, limit (again?)).

Here’s what I tried to fill in:

* **Price:** 62
* **Take Profit Limit:** 61 (a message appeared saying it must be lower than the price)
* **Stop Loss Trigger:** 57.84
* **Stop Loss Limit:** 57.84

I couldn't get this to work because it says the stop loss trigger must be higher than the order limit price (???), but I tried putting it at 56, 57, 58, 61 and none worked. It only accepted a value above 62, but that seems like a strange trigger for a ""loss"" since it would be a profit.

Has anyone managed to set up such complex conditions, or is there a more efficient way to approach this? Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated!

Many investors track the movements of venture capital behemoths like a16z crypto to ensure their investment strategies are well-informed. The latest [State of Crypto Index](https://www.gncrypto.news/go_to/https://a16zcrypto.com/stateofcrypto/) report explores several crucial metrics that shed light on the prevailing sentiments in the market.

# [Key Positive Trends from the Report](https://www.gncrypto.news/news/a16zcrypto-no-panic-the-crypto-market-is-holding-up/)

1. There's been a notable increase in the number of unique users on various blockchains. The metric for active network addresses has reached a new high of 53.14 million, a testament to the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies.  


2. Mobile apps are currently the most favored method for storing cryptocurrencies, having increased to 28.37 million users. While this method may not offer the highest security, its convenience for quick transactions is a significant draw. The preference for mobile wallets by over half of all users suggests a substantial influx of newcomers into the market.  


3. The interest in crypto-related jobs continues to be strong, with an average of 1.6 applicants per vacancy. This is an improvement from November 2023, when there was one candidate per vacancy, though it is still below the record high in December 2021, when each vacancy attracted three applicants.
