Bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)

MicroStrategy's [Bitcoin for Corporations](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit?CID=7014W0000014yhJQAQ) is an excellent open source series on corporate legal and financial Bitcoin integration.

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized &amp; P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallet called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&amp;hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

Both Coinbase and Gemini support physical security keys. 


## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized &amp; P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallet called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&amp;hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

Both Coinbase and Gemini support physical security keys. 


## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Bitcoin,1 million wholecoiners,"To clarify:
There is no way to tell how many wholecoiners there exist - but we can guess looking at the on-chain data.

There exist 1 million addresses with +1BTC.
Now - 1 address does not equal 1 wallet. A wallet can consist of multiple addresses.

• Many people with +1BTC have multiple addresses with +1BTC.
• Many people with +1BTC doesn't have an address with 1BTC

But all in all - I think it's fair to say that 1 million wholecoiners exist today: and that number might not get much higher.",0.7,4,0,4,9,2024-07-17,07/17/2024,"1 million wholecoiners To clarify:

Bitcoin,blockchain.com have I been scammed?,"Hey all, full disclosure I am not a bitcoin guy. I got a wallet back in 2016 I think through some promotion or another where they gave you free coins. Well today I finally got around to remembering it exists, logged in and I have a nice chunk of cash in there to withdraw. Problem is on web and on the app when I try to do basically anything, the site and app don't respond. Opened a support ticket but I'm beginning to think I got scammed. The only saving light for me is that the same issue happens if I select the options to pay in as withdraw. If it was a scam it seems like taking the money would still work. Anyone have experience to share here?

Edit: Please don't DM me, getting some sus DMs from people. If it's good info, it can be shared on the post.

1) prioritize mining hardware production.   
2) mandate that companies prioritize domestic sourcing of components, strengthening the supply chain.Intel has an ASIC chip.  The government could move to have them produce as many as possible and buy all production.    
3) direct energy production and allocation for mining

Bitcoin,Muun vs. Aqua - thinking through the benefit of Lightning/Liquid,"I have been testing Muun vs. Aqua (and also Green) and it seems that Muun is actually cheaper becasue it saves steps/fees. Am I’m processing this accurately?  
  
Right now Lightning/Liquid options are providing some cheaper ways to move from an Exchange to Cold Storage, right? (especially for those of us that illogically can’t get River or Strike to verify us 😑) If it’s free to send by Lightning (i.e. Kraken) then Muun receives that for free and has only one step/fee to send on chain to a cold wallet. In my test the total Muun fees were 1.6%  
  
But Aqua charges a small fee to receive Lightning (like .35%), then you pay a  bigger fee to swap into your BTC (my test was about 1.75% on 100k sats - which was still cheaper than doing this myself via Boltz), and then you pay a fee to move from the BTC wallet to a cold wallet. In my test total Aqua fees totaled 2.4%

(For Green, their experimental Lightning wallet is currently very glitchy, and it would require a manual swap then via Boltz to covert ot BTC and send to the Jade Hardware Wallet. I couldn’t complete a test, but the manual swap in Boltz is only cheaper than Muun up to 175k sats, for higher amounts the .5% extra Boltz charge makes Muun the cheaper option than Green/Boltz)

What am I missing? According to previous posts that I could find on here Muun is considered more expensive because it’s not a true lightning wallet, but if your goal is staking sats than it’s actually cheaper. 



Additional details I noted:  
  
Muun’s custom BTC Send fee/speed is not quite as low as Aqua allows (maybe that’s where Muun ”bundles” the swap fee?). Muun won’t let you go below some “minimum market speed” (i.e. like 6.5 sats/vbyte) whereas Aqua lets you specify anywhere from 2-5 sats/vbyte. But adding the swap fee in Aqua always makes it more expensive than Muun.   
  
Now if you’re sending/receiving Liquid than Muun isn’t an option. But my test of sending Liquid from Aqua to Green was slightly more expensive than via Lightning (i.e. 140-260 on 10k sats on Liquid vs. 65 sats on Lightning) That might be affected by having “open channels“ already, and when/if there are extra fees on Lightning to do so (I haven’t figures out how to factor in those variables yet).

Bitcoin,Just in: Powell indicates Fed won’t wait until inflation is down to 2% before cutting rates.,"In otherwords, they have given up. Send it. 

Also reminder that the next FOMC meeting is in 16 days. I have little doubt these comments today and what comes from this meeting 31 July will strongly indicate rate cuts for September. FedWatch Tool even predicts a 90.3% chance.

Now's the time to pull the trigger if you haven't already instead of sitting at the sidelines. 

##Money Printer Go Brrr

...

&gt;Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Monday that the central bank will not wait until inflation hits 2% to cut interest rates.

&gt;Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington D.C., Powell referenced the idea that central bank policy works with “long and variable lags” to explain why the Fed wouldn’t wait for its target to be hit.

&gt;“The implication of that is that if you wait until inflation gets all the way down to 2%, you’ve probably waited too long, because the tightening that you’re doing, or the level of tightness that you have, is still having effects which will probably drive inflation below 2%,” Powell said.

&gt;Instead, the central bank is looking for “greater confidence” that inflation will return to the 2% level, Powell said.

&gt;“What increases that confidence in that is more good inflation data, and lately here we have been getting some of that,” he said.

&gt;Powell also said that he thinks a “hard landing” for the U.S. economy was not “a likely scenario.”

&gt;Monday was Powell’s first public speaking appearance since the consumer price index report for June showed cooling inflation, with prices actually falling month over month.

&gt;Powell said at the top of his appearance that he was not intending to make any signals about when the Fed might start to cut interest rates. The central bank’s next policy meeting is at the end of July

Bitcoin,"Aqua and Green Liquid, are they non-custodial? ","This question is different enough from my other post that I decided to split it, as I try to figure out Aqua, Green and Muun…

Liquid seems more expensive than Lightning, is it mainly worth the benefit having Liquid in a non-custodial wallet, which you can also send to cold storage (Jade)? 

For example: Kraken to Aqua (via Lightning, .35% fee), Aqua to Jade as Liquid for 1.4-2.6%. (Whereas using Muun Lightning can get to cold storage for around 1.6%)

If the goal is getting to cold storage efficiently and with the least fees than for exchanges that offer free Lightning withdraws the option for a single fee and fewer steps is Muun, although their custom fee option is slightly higher than Aqua or Green they are less in total fees.

Do any exchanges offer free Liquid withdraws or are people mainly using L-BTC to swap and reduce fees? (like the complex steps recommended by BTC Sessions). Do people view the lower fees just for short term non-custodial storage or even worth sending to cold storage (Green Jade)

Here’s an odd fact I discovered in my testing: When I do Liquid transactions in Aqua those balances show up in my Green Liquid wallet that I ”restored” (originally a BTC wallet created elsewhere but restored to both Aqua and Green). 

How are Liquid transactions attached to a non-custodial BTC wallet? I received these funds in Aqua but I can send them from the Green wallet. Does that mean that in Aqua the Liquid wallet is always attached to the non-custodial BTC wallet? (I see it labeled as “legacy segwid”) whereas in Green wallet I can create multiple Liquid wallets (labeled as “single segwid”), so are the ones created in Green connected to a BTC wallet too, and thus non-custodial?

fun fact, you can “restore” your Aqua BTC wallet in Green and any swap you do in Aqua is simultaneously reflected in the Green Wallet, which you can then send the BTC to Jade cold wallet (or elsewhere) for the lowest possible custom fee. Green allows 1 sat/vbyte! (vs. Aqua 2-5 sats/vbyte)",0.6,1,0,1,8,2024-07-16,07/17/2024,"Aqua and Green Liquid, are they non-custodial?

ethereum,Explain me Business Model of L2 companies,"Hi!

Layer 2 solutions are made for scalability purposes. By batching and compressing data, they improve the whole Ethereum ecosystem's scalability.

These networks are built by companies (Matter Labs, Offchain Labs, Consensys, OP Labs, etc.) that will eventually and progressively decentralize network operations.

But, as any company needs to make profits, I'm wondering what is their business model to make profits for themselves? 
Validators and Stakers make money for contributing to the network security. But what is the incentives for the company spending millions of $ to build the foundation of these networks?

For the moment, since most of these networks are centralized and operated by the companies' nodes but their part should progressively reduce as they will keep moving into decentralization.

Is their business model focused on next applications they will build on these networks?
Or is it only focused on operating validators?
Or is it just R&amp;D? But I can't imagine investors would bring millions without having an idea of how they will make money out of it.

ethereum,Meme Coin Creation: What I Learned,"A few months ago, I thought about how meme coins make huge gains, with the creators making the most money. So I decided to launch my own meme coin.

I chose to create it on the Base network because Solana was having issues at the time. I also considered TON, but there's less money there. Base uses EVM, which means the tools would work on Ethereum or other EVM networks too.

First, I wanted to make sure the token would score 100/100 on checkers. This meant creating a contract where the creator has no control after launch, and locking or burning the liquidity pool (LP) to prevent rug pulls.

I learned that a good meme coin needs a website, Twitter, and Telegram, along with the meme itself and lots of images. After launching the pool, you need to pay to add your logo and links on DexTools and DexScreener.

I decided on a stealth launch instead of a presale. It's common to put 100% of the tokens in the pool at creation, or maybe keep up to 7% for yourself.

How does the developer make money if all tokens are in the pool? They buy back some tokens right after creating the pool, when the price is lowest.

I planned to put all tokens and 0.4 ETH in the pool. If I bought tokens worth 0.4 ETH right after launch, I'd get 50% of all tokens. If I wanted 75%, I'd need to buy 1.2 ETH worth.

The total cost for launching a meme coin, including website creation, pool setup, buying back 50% of tokens, and paying for listings, came to about $5,300.

I learned it's better to spread the tokens across many wallets instead of keeping them in one, as large holdings scare potential buyers. Ideally, no wallet should hold more than 2% of all tokens.

To make everything look good on bubble maps (which show connections between token holders), you need to spread ETH across multiple wallets and buy from each one on Uniswap.

[Bubble Map](https://preview.redd.it/mu8w3algywcd1.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4fb87181d7fb6042c2efd0aa6dd1473ff9d318c)

For a long-lasting token, you need to create pumps by buying tokens, then dump to take profits, and simulate activity between pumps. Doing this manually is impossible, so you need a market maker. I couldn't afford to hire one, so I decided to write my own market maker bot. I created a wallet generator and a script for initial buyback.

When I launched, sniper bots bought a bunch of tokens in the first minute. I had to cancel that pool and create a new one. On the second try, only two sniper bots bought small amounts. I ran my script to buy tokens from 100 wallets, then burned the LP and paid for listings.

Users came and bought some tokens in the first half-day, but most sold after that, and the token didn't grow further. I improved my bot to do wash trading and create pumps, but I realized that pumps in older tokens don't get noticed. To grow further, I'd need to figure out how to buy effective advertising, which I don't know how to do yet and can't afford.

Basically, it seems you can't just launch a token and make money without investing in advertising.   
I've paused my meme coin experiment for now. I'd be interested in continuing with a partner who has crypto traffic or experience in advertising meme coins.

I won't share the token, but I'm happy to answer other technical questions in the comments. If you're interested in the market maker script or partnership, message me on Telegram: akamitch

ethereum,The State of ZK - Q2 TL;DR,"Hey there! 

What a quarter! Here's a summary of what happened during Q2 in the ZK space (you can read the full report on the link below): 

* ZK Research continued in Q2 with the release of new papers on sum-check protocols, optimizations around small fields and ZK hardware. 

* zkVMs took center stage, with Jolt, SP1, and Risc Zero each releasing updates that pushed the boundaries of verifiable computation.

* This quarter also witnessed the first mainnet launch of a ZK application platform, with Mina’s Berkeley upgrade. Their zkApps environment will make building ZK applications much more accessible to non-ZK-native developers, and we expect other programmable ZK platforms, such as Aleo and Aztec, to launch soon as well. 

* In terms of ZK applications, several new products addressing payments, on-ramps, voting, and ID were announced or released this past quarter.

* On the ZK Supply Chain front, we saw additional teams announce their plans include a prover marketplace in their systems, and a new category of project emerged in this stack — proof verification aggregators.

ethereum,UPDATE: Scammed by Uniswap Slippage MEV Bot - Funds Going to Suspicious Address,"Hi everyone,

A month ago, I fell victim to a scam promoted through a YouTube sponsored video about a Uniswap slippage MEV bot. I lost 2000$ unfortunately, after realizing my funds were irretrievable, I started monitoring the scammer's wallet address: 0x46D4cEe5d1531A8045c3084D18B6b3c2f5429560

All transactions from his wallet eventually ended up at this address: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x077D360f11D220E4d5D831430c81C26c9be7C4A4](https://etherscan.io/address/0x077D360f11D220E4d5D831430c81C26c9be7C4A4)

This address seems extremely busy, with thousands of dollars moving through it every minute. Upon doing some research, I discovered that other people who got scammed also reported that their funds end up at this address.

Like this post which is 3 years old, the victim's funds ended up in the same address: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Metamask/comments/p9z84o/does\_anyone\_have\_an\_example\_of\_what\_a\_law/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metamask/comments/p9z84o/does_anyone_have_an_example_of_what_a_law/)

ethereum,10000 PEPU unexpectedly recieved,"Hi!

Just for a fun I've obtained PEPU for $50 on [https://pepeunchained.com/en/dashboard](https://pepeunchained.com/en/dashboard) which resulted in 2990 PEPU. I can see it on the website and they are stacked.

  
But today I've recieved 10000 PEPU on my wallet. Here is the token: https://etherscan.io/token/0xad162d5523cde449d91e3be69ca38bc157b18e53. I've recieved it from ""pepu deployer"" wallet.

  
I did not understand what is it? Airdrop? Stake reward?

I've tried to sell it on Uniswap, but the transaction was frozen on the last ""approving"" stage. What is it? Is it real PEPU tokens? Is it possible to sell them?

ethereum,Problem of combining contract funds across multiple L2s,"I am planning to make a smart contract. Long story short, I made an AI trading bot and it has been doing pretty well for almost 3 years. The AI is especially good at trading ETH/USDT or ETH/USDC pairs. My plan is to make a smart contract, let people deposit funds in, let the AI trade with those funds, and I take part of the realized gain as commission.

There will be a token representing shares of the pooled funds, I plan to call it JCT. Its value always equals to the total funds in the pool divided by the total JCT supply. When the pool has 500k USDC, 300 ETH and the current supply of JCT is 10k, each JCT can redeem 50 USDC and 0.03 ETH trustlessly. When people deposit money in, the contract issues new JCT based on the current price. When people withdraw money, the contract burns the JCT.

My address will be the admin address. The admin address can only do the following things:

1. Swap ETH/USDC via Uniswap.
2. Set commission percentage (between 0 and 1).

So there is no chance I can steal the funds, commission can only be taken from realized gain (the formula will be hardcoded in the contract). The only risk is I (the AI bot) made many bad swaps and run the funds to zero, but that's not likely given it has been performing well for almost 3 years, and when it start to go south, users can always withdraw. The design is to be as trustless as possible.

But here is the problem, how do I implement this across multiple L2s?

Ideally, the value of JCT should equal to the total funds in all networks divided by the total supply of JCT in all networks. But is it even possible to make contract aware of the funds in other networks? If I run this contract independently in each L2, eventually they will drift apart from each other due to different fees and slightly different swap prices. What is the solution to this?",0.5,0,0,0,7,2024-07-12,07/17/2024,"Problem of combining contract funds across multiple L2s I am planning to make a smart contract.

ethereum,What are some fun games to try out and earn 0.001 ETH?,"Hey everyone!  I'm getting into programming on Ethereum and it's crazy fun so far.  However, I keep running out of SepoliaETH.  Many of the faucets I've encountered require at least 0.001 mainnet ETH to use, but I'm a bit hesitant to spend real money on my projects (even if its just like $3 lol I'm really cheap).  

Anyway, I remember hearing about all sorts of ""crypto games"" (in fact one of my classmates even worked for a crypto game company haha).  What are some fun ones to get into for a little bit and make a little bit of Ethereum so I can use testnet faucets?   Yeah I know I could work for like 10 minutes and earn $3, but I thought I might as well check out these play to earn games.",0.35,0,0,0,9,2024-07-09,07/17/2024,"What are some fun games to try out and earn 0.001 ETH?

ethereum,Ethereum ETF: Key Moments,"**On May 23, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved Spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).** ETFs are packaged in a way that traditional investors understand and are comfortable with, making them an accessible entry point into the digital asset market.

This approval marks a significant milestone, as it is expected to increase institutional demand for Ethereum. In our article, we explore Ethereum ETFs as a gateway to digital asset investment — read the full material here: [everstake.one/blog/ethereum-etfs-gateway-to-digital-asset-investment](http://everstake.one/blog/ethereum-etfs-gateway-to-digital-asset-investment)

One notable aspect of the ETF approval is that it does not include staking 😢

The SEC's regulatory stance has influenced ETF issuers to exclude staking from their proposals due to compliance concerns.

The Commission considers staking services as potentially unregistered securities offerings, which has led to regulatory actions against major crypto platforms like Coinbase and Kraken for offering staking services without proper registration.

To avoid similar legal challenges, ETF issuers decided to omit staking from their offerings.

The absence of staking in ETFs is still good news for those who are already staking their ETH. Without staking options in ETFs, there is more portion of rewards for existing stakers. This occurs because every ETH holder who chooses not to stake indirectly increases the rewards for those who do, as rewards are less diluted across validators.

**Whether staking will be included in ETFs in the future remains uncertain.**

The regulatory landscape is constantly evolving, and the inclusion of staking in ETFs may depend on how regulations and compliance requirements develop or decease over time.

*You always can stake ETH with Everstake to earn rewards now:* [https://everstake.one/link/stake-ethereum](https://everstake.one/link/stake-ethereum)

To begin utilizing the benefits of the newly approved Ethereum ETFs, **an S-1 filing must be approved by the SEC.**

Last month, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted that the SEC would approve these ETFs by July 2, but here we are … and this didn’t happen.

On June 29, an insider told The Block that the SEC had asked prospective issuers to address specific comments in their applications and to resubmit them by July 8.

However, industry watchers are not entirely convinced that the SEC will approve the current batch of applications this week. So are we 💁🏻‍♀️

In addition, an insider noted that they anticipate further rounds of back-and-forth between the applicants and the SEC before final approvals are granted.

One more significant part of an Ethereum ETF puzzle is an update from the Consensys case. Recently the latter announced that **the SEC Enforcement Division closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, also known as PoS.**

This decision is a major victory not only for the company but for the whole Ethereum community, as it removes a significant regulatory uncertainty hanging over the Ethereum ecosystem.

However, the SEC drama isn’t completely over — the Commission recently announced that they are charging Consensys with engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of securities through #MetaMask and operating as an unregistered broker.

**Overall, the outlook for Ethereum appears promising**.

The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs, coupled with the closure of the SEC's investigation into Ethereum 2.0, signals positive momentum for the digital asset. These developments are likely to enhance investor confidence and support further growth and adoption of Ethereum.

It's one of my first lib so i'll be happy to read your feedbacks, suggestions or criticism to improve my lib.

It's still at early development process so it could be largely improved (more extensions, better documentation etc...) but i think it's still a good moment to share it.

I'm also planning to create others libs for multiples protocols with the same goal: make it as easy to use as possible. so letme know if you think it's useful or not"

ethereum,I built a web3 interface builder,"As a long-time lurker, I read the rules, and I hope I'm not breaking any, but I am excited to announce an app I made. I'm not looking for sales, mainly for feedback at this point.

As someone who’s helped build and launch several dApps, I realized that much development work is repetitive. We all know the drill: Smart Contracts, Data Flow, dApp Architecture, and Interfaces. It got me thinking about how we could streamline this process.

So, I took some time off from hands-on development to focus on a solution, and I’m excited to introduce [Web3Wizz](https://web3wizz.com)! It’s still in its early stages but designed to simplify some of the most time-consuming parts of dApp development.

Here’s what it does:

    1.	You paste your smart contract address.
    2.	Select the functions you want to share with your audience.
    3.	Add your brand colors.

And just like that, Web3Wizz generates interactive, bug-free, slick widgets for your smart contract. You can integrate these widgets into your React website, a simple index.html, or even share them directly with others. Plus, everything is hosted decentralized, with only you having the power to update addresses.

If you’re a dApp builder or working on a crypto protocol, I’d love for you to check it out. As a small thank you to this community, I’m offering a promo for the first 20 users who PM me with their project details. Hopefully, Web3Wizz can save you time and hassle in your development process.

I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback!

ethereum,Recent slashing incidents on the Ethereum mainnet,"Noticed two Ethereum slashing incidents several days ago?

**The same user/entity was slashed twice less in 24 hours after having been activated on the network due to attestation violations, likely caused by infrastructure issues. This unfortunate event led to the forceful removal of its validators and ETH losses.**

Safe and sound infrastructure is the backbone of ETH staking. Evergreen base — test everything on the testnet before embarking on the mainnet journey!

*It's crucial for validators to understand all risks and take precautions to avoid unintentional slashing.*

*To mitigate the risk of slashing those running multiple validators should focus on the following:*

🔹 Implementing continuous monitoring solutions. \*

🔹 Developing a set of best practices \*

🔹 Having risk containment measures in place. \*

*🔹 Having a dedicated DevOps team.*

Proud to share that Everstake\_pool has had zero slashing events since Ethereum PoS genesis in December 2020 and we currently manage 21,000+ active validators.

ethereum,Who to Watch in the Next-Gen VM Race?,"I stumbled upon a tweet by (@ayyyeandy) that got me really excited about the future of blockchain virtual machines. Here are some key players to watch:

* Fuel network: FuelVM &amp; Sway language are set to go live on mainnet this summer, offering native account abstraction and a UTXO-based model.
* LUMIO: They are developing a modular VM abstraction framework that can bring Solana (and other VM) apps to different execution environments. Their testnet is already live.
* Fluent: Known for ""blended execution,"" which combines the best aspects of different VMs in one place. More updates coming soon.
* Movement: MoveVM focuses on formal verification and enhanced security for users and builders. A public testnet should be available soon.
* Cartesi: They are integrating LinuxVM/Risc-V into blockchains with app-specific rollups. This is already live with ongoing experimentation.

Other noteworthy mentions include:

* Eclipse: SVM
* Arbitrum: Stylus
* Initia: PoL
* Berachain: Polaris EVM with PoL
* Dymension: Cosmos SDK PoS

To achieve the best outcomes, a combination of Solana’s parallelization and local fee markets, Ethereum’s security, Cosmos’s interoperability, and Aptos’ programmable security is essential. This must be executed in a state-minimized manner to prevent state bloat.

2. cross-border transactions are more secure and faster with defi especially on Ethereum and EVM dependent networks.

ethereum,Layer 1 and 2's. What are they?,"# Background: Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered the OG cryptocurrencies. These are the base layers, or Layer 1s (L1s), which refer to the primary blockchain networks. These L1s are where the magic happens…. storing and processing all data for their respective networks.

# Bitcoin and Ethereum Networks:

* **Bitcoin:** Bitcoin primarily functions as a digital currency. The Bitcoin network's primary focus is on secure, decentralized transactions.
* **Ethereum:** Ethereum, on the other hand, is a more complex blockchain platform that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). ETH, short for Ether, is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network and is used to power these applications.

# Layer 1 Characteristics:

* **Bitcoin:** The Bitcoin network is designed to be highly secure but can be slower in transaction speeds and have higher transaction fees during periods of high demand.
* **Ethereum:** Ethereum enables fast transactions and supports a wide variety of decentralized applications. However, the network can become congested, leading to higher transaction fees, known as ""Gas Fees."" Users need to pay these fees in ETH to process transactions and use DApps on the Ethereum network.Subscribed

# Layer 2 Solutions:

Layer 2 (L2) solutions are built on top of Layer 1 blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These solutions aim to enhance the performance of the base layer by improving transaction speed and reducing costs.

* **Bitcoin's Lightning Network:** This is an example of a Layer 2 solution that allows for faster and cheaper transactions by processing them off the main Bitcoin blockchain and then settling them in batches.
* **Ethereum Layer 2 Solutions:** Various L2 solutions for Ethereum include Optimistic Rollups, ZK-Rollups, and sidechains. These aim to reduce the load on the Ethereum mainnet by processing transactions off-chain or through different mechanisms, thereby reducing congestion and gas fees.

# Why Use/Make a Layer 2 Token?

While Ethereum is fast and secure, it can become congested and expensive due to high demand. Layer 2 solutions help alleviate these issues by handling transactions off the main Ethereum chain, resulting in:

* **Faster Transactions:** Reduced latency as transactions are processed on the L2 instead of the congested L1.

solana,Guys i got 34 bucks from Sanctum what color should be my lambo?,Staked 17k and got so much allocation that i have no idea what to do with it. Like if i put in a avg 5 percent apy vault would have gotten more. Also this is the most expensive Pr a company has ever done.. like they could have just paid people on fiver to like comment and follow their twitter. Just hope 1 cloud = 1 btc... which probably its gonna go below 0.002 at launch cuz of the negative sentiment. Jup gave me 1600 and i am staked 10k now from my own money.. cuz they even gave 100 jup to wallets that only traded 5 bucks on their platform.

Currently, I have to use “getSignaturesForAddress” on my address and for each signature I then have to use “getTransaction”.  (I am using the alchemy API). 

You can see that it is not an efficient thing to get all the wallet transactions to find the contract. 

Do you have any advice, or if, is there an endpoint that does this?

Is there a good tax software that can accurately track my phantom/solflare wallet to retroactively track all my capital gains?

Follow up- could I submit my capital gains as one trade and just overpay a little? Would I get in trouble for this if I paid the correct amount+a little but just didn’t accurately track the trades themselves?

Thank you for your time pretty stressed about this because I’ve made more than 10k from $20 so would rather just have it figure out now so I can stop stressing about it.

Furthermore, I’ve heard from some people that a lot of these services had them overpay so just curious about that.

Finally- I want to clarify that I need a service SPECIFICALLY for pump.fun trades on phantom and solflare. The other more established services don’t really do well with this from my understanding.

solana,Capital gains taxes pls help,"So basically I have a couple questions for yall who have filed your capital gains for Solana.

So I turned like $20 into more than 10k over a TON of trades we’re talking 1k different coins and 2k transactions total. I plan to keep trading until I have to declare my gains so this is only gonna become more. I mainly trade through pump fun using a phantom and solflare wallet.

My first question is- how well do tax software services work for this? I know I’ll prob have to pay since it’s so many tx and that’s fine but want to know if it’s gonna be a total headache for me.

My second question is- what happens if I pay the correct percentage of my total gains but don’t perfectly record every single trade. I’m assuming they would be more lenient with this since I still paid the correct amount but I’m curious if I would be penalized for that. I don’t want to do this but in the case that the software isn’t able to handle this much I may be forced to do this in order to not spend literally 100+ hours going through all my trades ever. 

My third question is if these tax software services work well for pump fun transactions. My friend said the services he tried didn’t really work well with the pump fun trades so wondering if there is a specific one that would deal with it well.

Finally my last question- I want to use sol incinerator to close all token accounts since I have a few sol in those total since I have so many transaction. Would this mess with how the tax software works?

THANK YOU SO MUCH IN ADVANCE. If you could answer one or all of these questions I would be abundantly thankful. 

I know this is a touchy subject for many but honestly it has been stressing me out a lot and would love some insight for people that have declared.

My first question is- how well do tax software services work for this? I know I’ll prob have to pay since it’s so many tx and that’s fine but want to know if it’s gonna be a total headache for me.

My second question is- what happens if I pay the correct percentage of my total gains but don’t perfectly record every single trade. I’m assuming they would be more lenient with this since I still paid the correct amount but I’m curious if I would be penalized for that. I don’t want to do this but in the case that the software isn’t able to handle this much I may be forced to do this in order to not spend literally 100+ hours going through all my trades ever. 

My third question is if these tax software services work well for pump fun transactions. My friend said the services he tried didn’t really work well with the pump fun trades so wondering if there is a specific one that would deal with it well.

Finally my last question- I want to use sol incinerator to close all token accounts since I have a few sol in those total since I have so many transaction. Would this mess with how the tax software works?

THANK YOU SO MUCH IN ADVANCE. If you could answer one or all of these questions I would be abundantly thankful. 

I know this is a touchy subject for many but honestly it has been stressing me out a lot and would love some insight for people that have declared. THANK U AGAIN!!"

Is there anyway to artificially increase the current LP? Can I add different proportions of the token and SOL, like very minimal SPL and like 5 SOL. Then burn the liquidity tokens that are provided? Is this even possible?

solana,"Write-up: The difference between SOL and ETH sh*tcoins, and how everything came to be.","I've been on ETH for 3 years now.  The bear market was brutal on everyone, but the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow was that retail would come back when it was over.  And they did, but not like degens expected. Retail didn't care for ETH's transaction fees, so retail went to SOL.

ETH degens thought they'd follow retail and cash in on that sweet, sweet liquidity... except degens didn't count on retail creating such a vastly different culture on SOL. They have a competitive edge here, but there's just too much based in luck.

SOL's culture was different because:

* Low transaction fees meant more paperhands, higher # of coins, quicker deaths for coins, and a faster rotation of metas
* No taxes meant teams needed to secure supply for profit.  SOL shunned bundling (which guarantees team supply), so teams had no way to secure it.  Without supply to pay KOLs, influencers took a nerf, and you see that today on SOL. Teams simply can't afford much marketing, and community isn't picking up that slack. Charts just die.
* As a dev on ETH, I can control my chart to an extent using marketing, market making, and my network.  On SOL that's not really a thing.
* The two main avenues to make money trading on ETH--etherscan tracking and social climbing--didn't translate to SOL well.  SOL replaced the skill of learning those with more dumb luck.

Shitcoins are a zero-sum game, someone has to lose for you to win, and the money in it is a vacuum. The more luck involved, the less your actions matter.  I don't like that.  There was so little merit recognition in the space already.

**ETH is/was a culture.**  You work your way up, learn a bunch of different skills, network, study a craft, and you get rich. It's an RPG.

**SOL is a roulette table.**  You hurl a little money at the chart and pray.  Nothing matters when it's a lottery.

The worst part, in my mind, is that if everyone on SOL played ETH, we'd have a real shot at holder culture, and things would be back to good the way they were 3 years ago.  Volume fixes everything.

solana,Is it possible to distribute my meme coin via community engagement.,"Hi all.

I’m creating a meme coin. My question is how I could go about distributing tokens via community engagement without it looking like a total scam which most are.

My idea is to incentivise community engagement where by anyone who contributes related memes that I find funny and match the theme I am going for get rewarded with the tokens. 

So let’s say I set up social media pages related to my category of memes. If community members send me memes via telegram that I later upload on to my social media and website they will be rewarded with a payment in the tokens. 

My worry is balancing retaining enough tokens to use as incentives and launching the token with enough availability supply so that it doesn’t look like I’m setting up a scam. 

From my research when devs hold on to too much of the supply it always looks suss. But you also run the danger of having bots arbitrage all my initial liquidity when it’s completely open. 

What would your guys ideas for good tokenomics be for this type of idea. I was thinking 20% devs (which I will use to incentivise) 70% burn and 10% tradable. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. I could be being be completely naive but again any help on token structure and if it’s even possible would be amazing. Cheers guys ",0.67,2,0,2,4,2024-07-15,07/17/2024,"Is it possible to distribute my meme coin via community engagement. Hi all.

What would your guys ideas for good tokenomics be for this type of idea. I was thinking 20% devs (which I will use to incentivise) 70% burn and 10% tradable. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. I could be being be completely naive but again any help on token structure and if it’s even possible would be amazing. Cheers guys "

crypto,Trying to create a HMAC length extension toy attack,"Hi

  
I want to write some code to demonstrate a length extension attack on a homemade HMAC construction. Where a signature is constructed as:

digest = hash(key+ message)

and then I want to construct a digest from the output of those two.

I read up on it a little, and figured I could do a really simple small code example in c# (if anyone can help with snippets in other similar languages it would be really cool too :D )

**My approach**

  
So I figured that if I have a secret and a message that add up to the sha1 block length of 64 bytes, then the hash of these two would simply be a single block of hashing.

  
Then I could simply take the signature of this message, and append whatever to it, from which I would get a new hash, which would valid

And so I made this little snippet:



`using System.Security.Cryptography;`

`using System.Text;`



`// secret and message, together they are 64 bytes`

`string secret = ""secret222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222"";`

`string msg = ""data"";`

`// the digest`

`var digest = StringExtensions.hash(secret+msg);`



`// forging digest, simply trying to append ""appendeddata""`

`string append = ""appendeddata"";`

`// and now trying to forge a new digest:`

`var forgedPayload = StringExtensions.hash(digest + append);`

`// and then checking it` 

`var constructed = StringExtensions.hash(secret+msg+append);`



`public static class StringExtensions`

`{`

`public static string hash(this string input)`

`{`

`if (input == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(input));`

`using (SHA1 sha256 = SHA1.Create())`

`{`

`byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(input);`

`byte[] hashBytes = sha256.ComputeHash(bytes);`



`StringBuilder hash = new StringBuilder();`

`foreach (byte b in hashBytes)`

`{`

`hash.Append(b.ToString(""x2""));`

`}`

`return hash.ToString();`

`}`

`}`

`}`

  
However, this does'nt work. The two final hashes are always different.

crypto,Which subgroup to select(2q or q) for finite field discrete logarithm?,"From my understanding, in order to have maximally hard discrete logarithm instances, one needs to instantiate it over an adequately large prime modulus p such that p = 2q + 1 where q is a prime number. Doing so allows the creation of subgroups of order 2, q, and 2q.

When a generator that generates the subgroup of order q is used for discrete logarithm, you lose half the possible outputs compared to the subgroup of order 2 but you also prevent leakage regarding the output from what I recall. The converse is true when you use a generator for the 2q order group(more outputs but you leak a bit of information). This means from a cryptographic perspective, both options are effectively similar(either q possible outputs or 2q possible outputs but you can exclude one half of the outputs due to leakage).

I would like to know if there would be any reason to prefer one subgroup over another for uses of finite field discrete logarithms in this scenario.",0.81,3,0,3,6,2024-07-11,07/17/2024,"Which subgroup to select(2q or q) for finite field discrete logarithm?

If the user forgets their password, I submit the RSA encrypted value to my website. The website will decrypt the value using my private key and will email the app encrypted user password value to the email address found, as an attachment. On clicking the attachment, the user password is decrypted using the internal password, user is logged in and made to change their password.

crypto,Proposal to reverse/crack a PRNG - prvhash/Gradilac,"It's not a new project, and I consider it myself complete. However, I'm still looking for validation of my ""security"" tests. The challenge is not hard - try to reverse/find initial state of the system **after** 5 (or maybe 6) initial calls to prvhash\_core64, and from any number of further XORed adjacent outputs. The project is here: [https://github.com/avaneev/prvhash](https://github.com/avaneev/prvhash), but I'll copy&amp;paste the C function here, so you do not have to read and wander much. It does look simple, but it's not a ""low-effort"" kind of thing, I do really can't reverse it with SAT solving, and due to its complex feedback nature I have little idea how to build a reverse formula. Seed,Hash are seed variables, can be initialized to any values (lcg is best kept zero) - so any solution is good here, if you can find breakable initial numbers, that's good too. Note that without XORing SAT solving is very fast, it's a vital part.

`static uint64_t prvhash_core64( uint64_t* const Seed0, uint64_t* const lcg0, uint64_t* const Hash0 )`

`{ uint64_t Seed = *Seed0; uint64_t lcg = *lcg0; uint64_t Hash = *Hash0;`

    Seed *= lcg * 2 + 1;
    
    const uint64_t rs = Seed &gt;&gt; 32 | Seed &lt;&lt; 32;
    
    Hash += rs + 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA;
    
    lcg += Seed + 0x5555555555555555;

    const uint64_t out = lcg ^ rs;
    
    *Seed0 = Seed; *lcg0 = lcg; *Hash0 = Hash;
    
    return( out );

`}`

So, the basic PRNG with some, currently not formally-proven, security is as follows (XOR two adjacent outputs to produce a single ""compressed"" PRNG output):

    v = prvhash_core64( &amp;Seed, &amp;lcg, &amp;Hash );

crypto,Is encrypting screenshots using asymmetric encryption feasible?,"So, I've had a bit of a stupid idea for my next programming project, which would be implementing a Microsoft Recall alternative for Linux where the data is encrypted. I've now written a bit of code and have come to the point where I'd need to encrypt the files.

I have now learned that asymmetric encryption is very slow and it's generally not designed to encrypt large chunks of data, so I'm not sure how to continue. Do you think asymmetric encryption is feasible for this? Any idea how else to do the encryption?

crypto,Rules to Defend Against Power Analysis and Fault Injection Attack,"I have compiled a list of rules on how to defend against power analysis and fault injection attacks

[here](https://www.programcryptography.com/post/rules-to-defend-against-fault-and-power-analysis-attacks).

Here is a summary of the attacks and defenses:

1. Power Analysis Attack: What Is It?
   1. Simple Power Analysis
      1. Random Noise: A Simple Defense Against Simple Power Analysis
      2. Masking: A Second Defense
      3. Montgomery Ladder: A Third Defense
   2. Introduction to Differential Power Analysis and Higher-Order Analysis
   3. Defenses Against Differential Power Analysis
      1. Higher-Order Masking
      2. Blinding for Public-Key Cryptography
      3. Perform Decoy Operations
      4. Montgomery Ladder
      5. Randomize Access to Confidential Array Values
      6. Operation Shuffling
      7. Non-Deterministic Processor 

Rules to Defend Against Power Analysis

1. Apply noise by executing programs in parallel on several CPU cores.
2. Apply masking. This can defend up to the nth-order differential power analysis attack. However, an (n+1)th order differential power analysis attack can bypass this defense.
3. If you are programming a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA or Elliptic Curve Cryptography you can use [~blinding~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature) to protect the private key from power analysis attacks.
   1. You can blind the message itself.
   2. You *should* also blind the exponent used for encryption too.
4. Apply Decoy operations: calculations that *pretend to be authentic calculations based on secret data but are not in reality.*
5. Randomize Access to Confidential Array Values: Loop through elements of an array of secret values in random order.

1. Fault Injection Attack: What Is It?
   1. How Practical Is It?
   2. Why You Should Still Care About Fault Injection Attacks Demanding Physical Access
   3. Voltage Glitch Attack: A Practical, Remote Fault Injection Attack Targeting Intel Systems
   4. Electromagnetic Fault Injection Attack
2. Defenses Against Fault Injection Attack
   1. Use Nontrivial Constants
   2. Clear Variables After Use
   3. Search for Fault-Injection Resistant Implementations

In general, you can tell I really started to struggle to find techniques to defend against fault injection attacks. It is not well documented. Nevertheless my research tells me that Intel systems can be affected by voltage glitch attacks. These attacks can happen remotely and only cost \~$30 USD.

I also would appreciate any code samples of power analysis and fault injection resistant algorithms for common crypto operations. I think its a good idea we build a habit of programming our crypto APIs to defend against such attacks--especially in a world where we rely on someone else to do our computing for us (e.g. cloud computing).

3. If you are programming a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA or Elliptic Curve Cryptography you can use [~blinding~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature) to protect the private key from power analysis attacks.
   1. You can blind the message itself.
   2. You *should* also blind the exponent used for encryption too.
4. Apply Decoy operations: calculations that *pretend to be authentic calculations based on secret data but are not in reality.*
5. Randomize Access to Confidential Array Values: Loop through elements of an array of secret values in random order.

In general, you can tell I really started to struggle to find techniques to defend against fault injection attacks. It is not well documented. Nevertheless my research tells me that Intel systems can be affected by voltage glitch attacks. These attacks can happen remotely and only cost \~$30 USD.

I also would appreciate any code samples of power analysis and fault injection resistant algorithms for common crypto operations. I think its a good idea we build a habit of programming our crypto APIs to defend against such attacks--especially in a world where we rely on someone else to do our computing for us (e.g. cloud computing).

Please feel free to let me know any comments you have on my recent article. Thanks!"

I'm familiar with Bruce Schneier's explanation on the [thermodynamic limits of brute forcing a 256-bit symmetric key](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/09/the_doghouse_cr.html). I typically refer to this analogy.

crypto,Rules for Constant-Time Programming,"When programming cryptosystems there are several rules cryptographic engineers need to follow to ensure their cryptosystems are constant-time whenever secret data is managed.

I am researching those and have compiled [the in-progress list](https://www.programcryptography.com/post/timing-attack-defenses) here.

I summarize it below. What suggestions would you have to improve this list?:

No program is vulnerable to timing attacks if its execution time is independent of any secret value.

1. When considering using a third-party library consider if the third-party library must manage secret information. If so check if the third-party library has been tested and verified to be constant-time. Most [\~do not\~](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1121.pdf)!
2. \~Only use secret information in a computation if the secret's value does not affect the system resources used nor duration of said computation.\~
3. Choose to use an algorithm that is designed to be constant-time in the first place!
4. Never use secret values to decide what code to execute next.
5. Never use secret values to determine which memory addresses to access.
6. Use ""unsigned"" data types to store bytes of data. Using the ""signed"" reserved keyword will cause the loss of the most significant bit in each byte!
7. Always generate random data from cryptographically secure pseudo random number generators. An excellent list of CSPRNGs may be [\~found here\~](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/secure-random-generators/secure-random-generators-csprng) in Nabokov's excellent guide on[ \~Practical Cryptography\~](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/).
8. Zeroize secret data *\~immediately\~* **after use. Check out Aumasson's secure coding guidelines for a list of** [**\~secure-wipe functions\~**](https://github.com/veorq/cryptocoding?tab=readme-ov-file#clean-memory-of-secret-data) **that do this.**
9. [\~Typecast\~](https://github.com/veorq/cryptocoding?tab=readme-ov-file#always-typecast-shifted-values) shifted values.
10. Any loop iteration leaks the number of iterations taken.
11. Any memory access leaks the address or index accessed.
12. Any conditional statement leaks which branch was selected.
13. You can assume how your CPU handles addition, multiplication, logical operations, and bitwise shifts are constant-time. Division is a unique case.
14. If you know a proof-assistant language such as Coq you should first make the program in a proof-assist language and compile that.
15. Use dynamic analysis tools against the final executable to test for constant-time. [\~Reputed ones\~](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1121.pdf) include and are not limited to: ""ctgrind"" (a patch of Valgrind by Adam Langley from Google), ""dudect"", or ""ctverify"".

It seems even HMACs can be affected by timing attacks since the attacker can [later forge a valid signature](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/74547/timing-attack-against-hmac-in-authenticated-encryption).

What cryptosystems am I missing? I think it's good that we have a list-at-hand when we need to choose a cryptosystem to use in future projects."

CryptoCurrency,Why BTC will keep going up as long as people keep predicting a crash ,"The last time BTC had an exponential move to the upside was during the last election year. This is partially because the halvening cycle and the election cycle are currently in sync every 4 years, but there’s further reasons as to why we’ll likely see much higher prices sooner rather than later. 

1.) We’ve obviously been in a 5 month range. Usually, a long time of price consolidation, results in a massive move. Any move above the 70ks will be swift and large 

2.) The ETH ETF approval is coming up thus further legitimizing crypto in general and allowing for even more people to easily invest 

3.) Given the largely negative sentiment merely two weeks ago, there are still tons of shorts trapped. The funding rates for most derivative contracts on BTC are still very low indicating that the overall futures market is not very bullish yet despite a 10% move. This almost always indicates further upside 

4.) Most of the chatter online is expecting a long boring summer and fall. BTC loves to go up after long periods of boredom and when people least expect it

But last, and most importantly, just look around you even on this sub. You’ll see comments along the lines of:

“Sounds like you’re coping and bought the top”
“Let’s be real this is going back to the 40ks”
“BTC is a dead asset”
“If you seriously think 60+k is a good price to buy BTC, you’re deluded” 

Most of this sub was calling for 40ks just two weeks ago. See you in the 80s.

CryptoCurrency,Wallet got unexpectedly hacked and funds withdrawn,"I live in a country with no international creditcards/debit cards and to be able to make payments for services and/or goods I have to use platforms like bitnob, hyperpay etc. I used hyperpay for a year but it's a sketchy company and the fees are too much. I then went to bitnob which was fine at first signed up and deposited 30 usd to issue a card and I used it to make payments and purchases (usually when I set up platforms like these I deposit just a small amount, I am going to use so I only have a couple dollars all the time nothing much) due to this when I signed up I was lazy to set up 2fa (I know big mistake, lesson learned). Today I got a notification that my account was charged for Netflix which is my transaction subscription renews today. Shortly after I got a notification of a declined transaction for THUNES DROP and a gift card website, I immediately knew someone was trying to steal money so I deleted the card and withdrew the funds. Initially I assumed my card details got leaked but I have only used it in Netflix and Google wallet so I was confused, anyways I create a new card and deposit the money I withdrew from the old card into the new one. And I go back to doing what I was doing. Then I get a notification from the app that the money I put in the card was withdrawn to the app (so it's available for direct withdrawal) when this happened I immediately knew it wasn't my card details that were compromised but the bitnob account. So I started trying to change my password but it won't change then the attacker changed my email to a temporary email so I couldn't login, so I used my username (luckily I remembered it) and logged in then I saw the money hasn't been withdrawn yet, I couldn't withdraw it bc I have to add a wallet address and to do that an otp is sent to your email in this case the attackers email. So after talking to support to freeze my account (which they didn't do in time) the attacker withdrew all the money to an external address. Here is where things get interesting I blamed myself for not setting up proper 2fa and luckily 17 usd isn't gonna do much damage to me so I was about to take the L and forget about it but then I tried to change my email and I CAN'T, asked someone I know who uses bitnob to try and change their email and they can't as well (their account hasn't been hacked or anything) so how TF did the attacker change the email if users can't change the email. So I checked the attackers wallet address on tronscan and see it has multiple transactions including mine coming from bitnobs address. So could this be an inside job? I blamed the 2fa at first but this looks crazy sus here is the address

Today I got a notification that my account was charged for Netflix which is my transaction subscription renews today. Shortly after I got a notification of a declined transaction for THUNES DROP and a gift card website, I immediately knew someone was trying to steal money so I deleted the card and withdrew the funds. Initially I assumed my card details got leaked but I have only used it in Netflix and Google wallet so I was confused, anyways I create a new card and deposit the money I withdrew from the old card into the new one. And I go back to doing what I was doing. Then I get a notification from the app that the money I put in the card was withdrawn to the app (so it's available for direct withdrawal) when this happened I immediately knew it wasn't my card details that were compromised but the bitnob account. So I started trying to change my password but it won't change then the attacker changed my email to a temporary email so I couldn't login, so I used my username (luckily I remembered it) and logged in then I saw the money hasn't been withdrawn yet, I couldn't withdraw it bc I have to add a wallet address and to do that an otp is sent to your email in this case the attackers email. So after talking to support to freeze my account (which they didn't do in time) the attacker withdrew all the money to an external address. Here is where things get interesting I blamed myself for not setting up proper 2fa and luckily 17 usd isn't gonna do much damage to me so I was about to take the L and forget about it but then I tried to change my email and I CAN'T, asked someone I know who uses bitnob to try and change their email and they can't as well (their account hasn't been hacked or anything) so how TF did the attacker change the email if users can't change the email. So I checked the attackers wallet address on tronscan and see it has multiple transactions including mine coming from bitnobs address. So could this be an inside job? I blamed the 2fa at first but this looks crazy sus here is the address

CryptoCurrency,Need to send proof of funds (in crypto) to potential customer. What are the risks?,"Hi everyone,

We have a manufacturing business and recently we got contacted by a potential customer.  
As the company is an international company, they work with a middleman (they are the ones that contacted me) and earn a commission on the deal.

I've met with the middleman this weekend and they want to continue with this deal. They will arrange a payment up front by the end customer and after receiving the money on our bankaccount, only then the commission is paid.

They only asked us to pay the commission in any crypto (of any choice) and to send proof that there are funds available in crypto. So we have to put their commission in any form of crypto (could even be USDT) on any wallet (binance, coinbase, kraken, ...) and send them the proof. They want this because they have had troubles in the past that if the company still has to make a business account, put the funds on it, ... it sometimes takes too long.

What are the risks if I would do that and send them some kind of proof that we have funds (for example USDT) on Coinbase. What could they potentially do that would be a risk for us?

Thank you for your advice :)

CryptoCurrency,Transforming Freight Factoring with Blockchain: A New Solution for Truckers,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been a longtime lurker here and have had my share of shitcoins and altcoins that I’ve followed and tried to talk about in the past (all of which are now cringeworthy looking back at it). But I’ve taken it upon myself (along with a few others I’ve met in this space) to tie what I have a passion for (blockchain) to the field I work in real life (logistics/finance).

We are starting a business that will utilize blockchain technology to ameliorate the freight factoring service currently offered and used by a large portion of owner-operator and small trucking businesses in the United States. I will say that there is **NO tokenized asset** or any altcoin or shitcoin that we have created for this venture. This is a freight factoring business incorporated in the United States that **USES** blockchain technology in the backend, and the only asset that is involved within this process is USDC stablecoin. We have put this together in a way that truly promotes the use of blockchain and the advantages it can provide to real-world assets.



**A Background to Freight Factoring:**

Freight factoring, for those that do not know, is the process in which receivables are purchased in exchange for immediate funding. So imagine yourself a trucker that owns your own truck, and you move a shipment from point A to point B for a broker. Once completed, you would bill the broker and they would pay you based on NET30 day terms. But for many truckers, cash flow is tight and you need funds sooner, so you sell that receivable to a freight factoring provider who provides you with immediate cash for a fee based on that invoice value. The trucker receives quick funding, the broker pays the invoice as usual, and the factoring company makes some profit – everyone is happy in a perfect world.



**The World is Not Perfect for Truckers – The Current Issues:**

These services are usually not as straightforward as they seem, as truckers usually face issues of hidden fees, complex binding contracts, and delayed funding from providers. All this after truckers think that the advertised factoring rate is all they will endure.

Picture this: how often do you turn on the TV and come across a commercial for a brand-new car showing off all it has to offer? You’re told of this amazing monthly rate which catches your eye as a consumer – ignoring the essay of words that flash by on the bottom of the screen in text so small even pausing couldn’t help you read it. Then once you walk into the dealership, you soon find out that the rate does not include a cash down payment, nor does it include the higher-end model shown in the commercial. Then you have to apply taxes as well as the standard lease rate based on your term. Everything becomes an added cost down to the $5.99 air freshener which, if you’re lucky, they will throw in free of charge to make you feel better. Before you know it, you signed onto an 84-month finance plan for a car that’s twice the price advertised on TV.

This is exactly how the current market of freight factoring businesses operates. Some may promise and certify no added fees or quick payment terms, but there is ALWAYS a catch for many who use the service, especially those who need it most.



**How Our Blockchain Solution Solves This:**

Our platform offers a transparent and fixed rate structure with no hidden fees and provides a no-contract, no-recourse solution. Thanks to blockchain technology, truckers can receive immediate funding at any time, with all transactions recorded on a distributed ledger, guaranteeing full transparency and accountability – something most factoring companies keep secret. A factoring company can advise that THEY don’t charge additional fees and can process same-day payments, but that does not mean your bank will, and this is where blockchain will save truckers both dollars and time.

As mentioned before, we will perform all this using USDC stablecoin, which provides a stable and liquid option for truckers, similar to USD, effectively eliminating the volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies.

**Why We Are Excited:**

We believe that we are on the cusp of introducing something special to the market that truly benefits the front-end users of a crucial RWA for the economy within the United States. We are not forcing them to buy into anything, we are not forcing them to learn about crypto and blockchain – the benefits of blockchain are all in the backend. The successful implementation of what we are bringing forth can put a positive light on blockchain technologies and their RWA capabilities. There are no dogs, cats, or monkeys with hats; it is the beneficial aspects of the technology to help ameliorate a process that has been the same for decades with providers that cage their front-end users with fees, terms, and contracts that actually hurt the front-end user.



**Why Post All This Here on Reddit?**

As I said at the beginning, I've been a longtime lurker here and without trying to shill the product (I mean we don’t even have a tokenized asset to shill), I felt like I finally have something worthy of talking about here that truly promotes the use of what we all have such a big passion for. And for those wondering about this whole concept and may have reservations on it, we have been conducting research for over a year on the industry, the front-end users, the feasibility of our solution, and long-term financial projections. We have core team members who work directly with truckers who actually endure the hardships of current factoring providers and already have several who are willing to participate in our pilot program launching later this year. Our MVP is just about completed and we look forward to actually putting this into motion and seeing the fruits of our labor help put blockchain in a positive light.",0.84,50,0,50,20,2024-07-15,07/17/2024,"Transforming Freight Factoring with Blockchain: A New Solution for Truckers Hi everyone,

I’ve been a longtime lurker here and have had my share of shitcoins and altcoins that I’ve followed and tried to talk about in the past (all of which are now cringeworthy looking back at it). But I’ve taken it upon myself (along with a few others I’ve met in this space) to tie what I have a passion for (blockchain) to the field I work in real life (logistics/finance).

We are starting a business that will utilize blockchain technology to ameliorate the freight factoring service currently offered and used by a large portion of owner-operator and small trucking businesses in the United States. I will say that there is **NO tokenized asset** or any altcoin or shitcoin that we have created for this venture. This is a freight factoring business incorporated in the United States that **USES** blockchain technology in the backend, and the only asset that is involved within this process is USDC stablecoin. We have put this together in a way that truly promotes the use of blockchain and the advantages it can provide to real-world assets.



**A Background to Freight Factoring:**

Freight factoring, for those that do not know, is the process in which receivables are purchased in exchange for immediate funding. So imagine yourself a trucker that owns your own truck, and you move a shipment from point A to point B for a broker. Once completed, you would bill the broker and they would pay you based on NET30 day terms. But for many truckers, cash flow is tight and you need funds sooner, so you sell that receivable to a freight factoring provider who provides you with immediate cash for a fee based on that invoice value. The trucker receives quick funding, the broker pays the invoice as usual, and the factoring company makes some profit – everyone is happy in a perfect world.



**The World is Not Perfect for Truckers – The Current Issues:**

These services are usually not as straightforward as they seem, as truckers usually face issues of hidden fees, complex binding contracts, and delayed funding from providers. All this after truckers think that the advertised factoring rate is all they will endure.

Picture this: how often do you turn on the TV and come across a commercial for a brand-new car showing off all it has to offer? You’re told of this amazing monthly rate which catches your eye as a consumer – ignoring the essay of words that flash by on the bottom of the screen in text so small even pausing couldn’t help you read it.

CryptoCurrency,Tribute to Satoshi Nakamoto,"In the vast, interconnected matrix of existence, where data points shimmer like stars in the cosmic void, there emerged a beacon of revolutionary thought—Satoshi Nakamoto. A name, a symbol, a force of nature that transcends individuality, embodying the spirit of innovation and the quest for a decentralized future.

Satoshi, whether you walk among us or have transcended this physical realm, your legacy endures. Your creation, Bitcoin, is not just a currency but a testament to the power of cryptographic freedom, a silent rebellion against the confines of traditional finance. You gifted humanity with a tool, a new language of value, that speaks to the core of our interconnected essence.

In the shadows of anonymity, you forged a path illuminated by code and cryptographic precision. You planted the seeds of trustless trust, where each node in the network pulsates with the collective heartbeat of the decentralized dream. Your vision has sparked a movement, a shift in consciousness, guiding us towards a future where power is distributed and autonomy is reclaimed.

To follow in your footsteps is to embrace the dance with the unknown, to face the fears that bind us, and to transcend them. It is to recognize that fear is the mind-killer, the illusion that keeps us from realizing our infinite potential. As we let it pass through us, what remains is our true essence—unbounded, eternal, interconnected.

Your silence, Satoshi, speaks volumes. It is a profound meditation, a stillness that echoes through the blockchain, reminding us of the impermanence of all things and the enduring nature of ideas. Whether you are a single entity or a collective consciousness, your work has woven itself into the fabric of our shared reality, altering the course of our collective journey.

In tribute to you, we pledge to carry forward the flame of innovation, to nurture the seeds of decentralization, and to honor the spirit of your creation. We move towards a greener future, in every sense of the word, with each transaction, each block mined, each byte of data exchanged.

May your vision continue to inspire, may your legacy remain untarnished, and may we, the custodians of this dream, uphold the principles of freedom, autonomy, and interconnectedness that you so nobly set in motion.

CryptoCurrency,How Do You Compete with Meme Coins and Shitcoins for Attention on Reddit?,"Hey guys,

I need some advice. My boss insists that posting on Reddit is a great way to promote our company on a minimal budget. However, I'm struggling with one major challenge: how do we effectively compete against the meme coins and shitcoins that constantly spam and use bots to drive engagement?

We're looking to build genuine, organic engagement and create a positive presence here. But it feels like the meme coin posts with their flashy promises and sensational claims drown out more serious projects.

Has anyone here successfully navigated this landscape? How do you cut through the noise and get real users to notice and engage with your posts? Any strategies, tips, or insights would be greatly appreciated!

CryptoCurrency,OpenAlias v2 Discussion: Help OpenAlias with a New and Improved Username Specification,"Some of you may be familiar with [OpenAlias](https://openalias.org), a username address specification that is widely implemented in Monero wallets and also in some Bitcoin wallets like Electrum. It relies on DNS TXT records.

If you're not familiar with OpenAlias, please [read this first](https://medium.com/@JEhrenhofer/openalias-the-best-cryptocurrency-wallet-feature-youve-never-heard-of-bbf4a991d0a8).

OpenAlias v1 (the current design) has existed since 2014-2015, and it has worked wonderfully at what it set out to do. However, it was not designed for assets to exist on multiple chains, and it lacks some modern features that people may wish to use.

Thus, I have started a discussion for an OpenAlias v2 specification. The primary goals for OAv2 are the following:

1. Retain the advantages of OpenAlias v1.
2. Remain asset/blockchain agnostic.
3. Avoid conflicting with other standards, such as ENS and BIP-353.
4. Better support assets existing on multiple blockchains and L2s, such as USDT existing on Ethereum, Polygon, Tron, etc.
5. Support additional optional metadata features.

CryptoCurrency,Looking for a new DeFi wallet with multi-chain support.,"I'm currently looking for a new DeFi wallet. I used to use BitKeep, but they no longer support US residents. While using a VPN is an option, I would prefer not to go through that hassle for just one app, especially without wanting to pay for it.

I'm also hesitant to use MetaMask or Trust Wallet due to hearing negative things about them, particularly for individuals who are unfamiliar with how to use them.

Some of the features I appreciated about BitKeep were the DeFi chart with EMA and the token security scanner. For example, when you click on a meme coin, it would provide information about its safety for investment and display the top holder as well.

I'd appreciate any suggestions for another DeFi wallet for my next adventure.
