"Frustration with most of the other subs on reddit when Bitcoin is brought up. Just need to vent. It's still incredible to me how many downvotes just mentioning bitcoin gets. There was a popular post on videos subreddit recently where someone asked about the value of Bitcoin as a currency, outside the view of an investment vehicle. I mentioned that it's currently used for payment in impoverished countries in Africa where people don't have stable financial institutions to store their money. I was asked for sources, I provided a coindesk publication. Apparently it was too biased for their liking so I provided a Forbes article, and still received downvotes. It's hard to see this kind of news in mainstream media, because the news rarely cares about poor people in poor countries. So most news sources covering this type of stuff tend to be bitcoin centric publications.

There's two factors at play here, one a lot of people still don't like hearing about bitcoin, and the second being, people don't up/down vote on facts, they do it based on their feelings, which is problematic.

Anyway. Just a rant.",101,2024-07-04,Bitcoin,101,frustration sub reddit bitcoin bring need vent still incredible many downvote mention bitcoin get popular post video subreddit recently someone ask value bitcoin currency outside view investment vehicle mention currently use payment impoverished country africa people not stable financial institution store money ask source provide coindesk publication apparently biased liking provide forbe article still receive downvote hard see kind news mainstream medium news rarely care poor people poor country news source cover type stuff tend bitcoin centric publication two factor play one lot people still not like hear bitcoin second people not updown vote fact base feeling problematic anyway rant

Many of them are OG‚Äôs and I doubt these are their only crypto holdings. Think it will be a buy the news event.

"Blast From the Past &amp; Lessons Learned (13 Years Ago)  I was digging through old emails and came across my very first Bitcoin mining adventure 13 years ago on a AMD HD 6970. This was during the original run up of Bitcoin from under $1 to $30 within 3 months. It was only worth a few dollars but as a college student, anything was better than nothing. Sadly, as with most with Bitcoin OGs from back then, it was just that funny monopoly money thing that most of us sold after 10-20x gains. If only we had the actual conviction of ""the moon"" being $1 Million per coin rather than just $100 or $1000 dollars üòÜ

"[Unpopular opinion] Bitcoin should be analysed purely on fundamental and no technical analysis should hold true In stocks and forex technical analysis, traders and gurus like to note down imbalance price action or void during price expansion upward or downward. 
Then trade the trend continuation after these imbalances are filled. 

In BTC case, during the expansion from Sep last year, a lot of price imbalances were created as price shoot up to ATH without any technical analysis but purely caused by series of fundamental news events. 

And since, price consolidated after ""taking out previous high"".
This week price is going lower and lower with the general sentiment being fearful, ""break of structure"" lower than USD$60k.

I see a lot of gurus affirming that the low of this correction would be USD$44k or USD$32k, to fill all the imbalanced price point.

And...TO THE MOON! 

But here's my question, at this point of price, BTC would have dropped 40% - 50% from ATH. Would decentralized retail traders buy BTC at this price and rally to USD$100k purely based on technical?

If there is no rate cut this year, would price rally to another ATH once BTC price filled these imbalances?

I think not but change my mind.

"Future generations? Hello bitcoiners. I have a question: how does Bitcoin work for younger generations? Say for example whatever the generation is before gen alpha? Or even gen alpha we can say since most of them I don't think are working yet. If Bitcoin is going to be this supposed universal currency, but you have to ideally buy early and HODL, waiting for the price to increase, how does this then become a viable currency or technology for people who don't even have the ability to purchase it at this point in time because they're too young? They don't have jobs yet; maybe they're in kindergarten right now or still a little sperm in your testicles? 

There seems to be an unequal distribution, and unfair access to people who don't have the capacity to get in early. Because they weren't even born yet, or they were too young to buy.

I feel like it's similar to a real estate agent saying that you should have bought a house before the housing crisis, but you were like...in middle school. 

Ideally today is the best time to buy, or ideally 10 years ago was the best time to buy. But not everybody could do that. So doesn't that just create a large system of inequality, where the whales are the ones who will hold most of the Bitcoin wealth and everyone else who couldn't get in early (not the people who CHOSE not to get in early, I understand there is a difference) will be S.O.L.?

How will your grandchildren be able to purchase enough Bitcoin to live off of if the price is going to go to the moon and if this is going to become a normalized currency? 

I've been curious about this. Thanks for the insight to whoever responds.

"Bitcoin Miners' Selling Year-to-Date: What does it tell us? 1. **Bitcoin Miners Using Retail Investors as Exit Liquidity:**¬†When the U.S. approved Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, miners sent an unprecedented amount of bitcoins to exchanges. This happened just as interest in Bitcoin peaked, indicating that miners took advantage of the increased attention to sell off their bitcoins.
2. **Miner Behavior During Price Peaks:**¬†In March, when Bitcoin first exceeded $70,000 to set its current all-time high, miners significantly increased their bitcoin transfers to exchanges. However, this flow rapidly declined to below pre-March levels, despite the price remaining high. This indicates that miners are quick to sell at peak prices but soon run out of bitcoins they are willing to sell at those levels. This suggests that surpassing $70,000 again could be easier this time.
3. **Impact of the Fourth Bitcoin Halving:**¬†Since the fourth Bitcoin halving two and a half months ago, miners have been compensating for their reduced rewards by drawing from their reserves. This is clear from the decrease in miner reserves and a steady net flow to exchanges. However, this strategy has its limits, as miners are running out of bitcoins to sell.

"Artificial intelligence will create significant wealth, and bitcoin will play an important role in preserving this new state - Anthony Pompliano (well-known investor and founder of Pomp Investments) **The Role of AI and Bitcoin in Wealth Creation**

Pompliano noted that many people used to focus on Bitcoin and the crypto sector in general. Today, the focus has shifted to artificial intelligence, and in his opinion, this is not a bad thing.

*‚ÄúBut I think people are kind of missing that these are actually part of the same trend.‚Äù*¬†he said.

The investor points out that the world is moving towards an era of automation, when artificial intelligence will create enormous wealth. And when this era becomes a reality, bitcoin's responsibility will be to protect it from AI.

*‚ÄúWhen you see these technologies coming together, an easy way to see the intersection is what money are these machines going to use?‚Äù*¬†Pompliano stated during the interview.

Pompliano believes that as artificial intelligence develops and grows through investment, investors will return to Bitcoin. When this happens, he is convinced that the United States will experience a GDP growth thanks to the productivity of AI. Bitcoin's ability to participate in this potential massive artificial intelligence development could lead to a recovery in the coin's price.

In his opinion, the recent drop in bitcoin is the result of investors' decision to invest in artificial intelligence. But Pompliano isn't worried about the current 15% price drop, pointing out that bull markets typically see several price pullbacks of 30% or more.

*‚ÄúA lot of people in public markets say ‚Äúinvest in until May and go away‚Äù and as a result, the second and third quarters tend to trade sideways ‚Äî particularly in halving years‚Äù*¬†he explained.

Pompliano believes that a similar situation is observed now, but expects another price rally to take place in the last quarter or early 2025, which is also a historical trend in halving years.

"My answer to the allocation question There are so many people (once they've become orange pilled) that ask the question: ""So should I go 100% into bitcoin??""  ""Should I DCA?""  ""Should I sell all my stocks/bonds?""  Basically, what do I do now that I realize that bitcoin is the answer to the broken fiat problem?  I've been in bitcoin since 2018 and wanted to share my perspective and hopefully it's helpful to new bitcoiners as they start their path.

First off - do not go ""all in"".  I would say this for any investment, ever.  So many people think they've found the holy grail in stocks, just to be shaken out and then eventually sell the company they believe in, often times right before it makes a big leap up in price.  You have to understand that often markets (any market) is manipulated in a way to try to have typical investors sell low and buy high.  It's psychological warfare that you just need to assume for the purpose of this post that you are unequipped to manage properly.  So you need to HODL.  But hold what and how much?

If you are truly orange pilled, you need to understand two things:

1. Stocks (and companies) still have value.  They are still an entity that sells a product, makes a profit, and employs people.  Stocks are just valued in fiat, which is a mistake, but most companies already get this.  They don't hold fiat in their reserves, they buy back their stock with profits.  Which actually works just fine.  Holding bitcoin would be a better strategy but a company's stock price can do just fine if the company is growing, is profitable, and is constantly buying back it's stock or reinvesting in itself.  Apple, Google, and Amazon are going to do just fine and you should continue to hold baskets of stocks in ETFs.  You need to diversify.

2. Bonds are garbage.  Bitcoin isn't replacing the S&amp;P500, it's replacing bonds.  Bonds are the preferred fiat investment that's ""rock solid"" and most people use as a store of value in a way.  This is the biggest mistake of the 21st century.  With bitcoin, and the approval of the spot ETFs, you now have a way (in your 401k or brokerage accounts) to hold bitcoin.  Bonds will never keep up with true inflation.  Also, as your country's debt (let's take USA as the example here) continues to climb, the government is going to have to pay for it.  They'll increase taxes and make a big splash of it, but it won't cover the bill.  They are going to have to issue more and more garbage bonds at higher prices, which means more payout, which means more printing, which means more inflation, etc, etc forever until bonds are 10%+ and anything you might be holding now is complete crap.

So the answer to the allocation question is now simple.  It's a 60/40, 50/50, or 40/60 split which should be decided by the person's risk tolerance.  Personally I'm 50/50 in my retirement account and then I hold some bitcoin in cold storage and some individual stocks that I believe in with a brokerage account.  But more or less, I'm about 50/50 on my liquid investments (take out house/mortgage etc).  This has personally helped me in the past when bitcoin dips and stocks surge.  You need to have both so you don't make the mistake of selling one to buy the other.  You need both and personally, I think you need both equally.  The biggest mistake you can make in investing is to constantly buy and sell.  You cannot time any market, you need to play the long game, and the long game is high quality S&amp;P500 stocks, and bitcoin.  Companies will eventually hold bitcoin which will resolve the issue of worrying about companies that don't keep up with bitcoin (this was Saylor's point of why you should be in bitcoin 100%).  But this will shake out naturally.  Value will find a home with companies that use bitcoin as a store of value, but this will take years to come to fruition.  Don't try to time this, just let it happen naturally.

In this new bitcoin world that we are going to watch emerge in the next 5 years, both stocks and bitcoin will do well, but understand they are both different investments and are both worth your energy.

"Local Bitcoins Withdrawal Delays (9 years later)  Long story: In 2015, I had 1.5 bitcoins in LBC when Bitcoin was $200, and my account got locked after 2 transactions because of my counter-parties (I'm assuming).

In 2024, after repeatedly receiving emails to withdraw my bitcoins, I went through a bunch of steps to reset 2 factor verification and got in - only to realize I still couldn't withdraw my coins, which by now had grown to over $80,000. 

After 3 months of back-and-forth, I was finally able to complete my verifications and withdrew this morning to a SegWit address after my account was ""terminated.""  I then downloaded my user data, which shows the outgoing transaction was correctly processed, the fee deducted, and the coins sent to the right address. But I still don't see the coins on the block explorer several hours later. 

On the website, it says there could be a ""60 day delay"" for outgoing transactions. I'm not sure what this means or if it is applicable to my situation.

"Suggestion wanted for tax planning So I have been building a nest egg with Strike and sending it to my hardware wallet. This allocation is easy to keep track of and will be straight forward when it comes to taxes.

But here is my problem: I also moved some funds from an old ledger hardware wallet to this hardware wallet (before I sent Strike to it). These funds were all the altcoin experimentation that eventually got converted to Bitcoin. But I can't accurately account for where most of it came from as back then I used many exchanges that went under or I closed the account long ago.Which is too say I WONT be able to accurately account for it. This btc was actually an overall loss at the time I sent it over.

My question is what to do? Should I move the non strike btc to a seperate wallet? or move the Strike bitcoin to it's own wallet?  If I sold the non strike btc in the future could I try to use the price of btc when I moved it from (it was a small loss before then but I'd have trouble showing it) Ledger to current HWW?

"Superintelligence Alliance. Anything behind it? Or just a cash grab? Afternoon all! 

I am asking a genuine question and it's not trolling but what does everyone think about the recent merge of SingularityNet / Fetch / Ocean Protocol? 

My personal viewpoint is that none of the projects really did anything and just used ""AI"" as tool to market as all three projects have been around for since 2017 / 2018 and I've never seen a single product from them. 

Ocean Protocol has changed what it is numerous times since it's inception back in 2017. It was originally about data and monatizing data for users / privacy without AI. That seems to have shifted.  

SingularityNet from what I can see just uses itself as a launch pad to spin off more projects that again do very little and a cash grab. The biggest news I can see from that project was moving to Cardano, but outside of that I see nothing. I see these as the biggest offenders simply because they just bleed their community every few months to invest. 

Fetch i don't know much about but i'm willing to guess it's a similar story. No product and using AI for marketing. 

I see this merge as a way for them to reinvent hype and possibly cover up the fact they haven't really done much for seven years. On top of that, If you combine the market caps of all of them you get a rather high ranking token which seems to also be another reason (They are now in the top 30). 

I'm curious to hear your view points and open to changing my mind but I just don't see what any of the projects have done and can claim to be leading AI. ChatGPT has pushed out more things in 6 months than any of these companies have in six years.

"Crypto Industry Lost $572.7m to Hacks in Q2  The second quarter of 2024 recorded a loss of cryptocurrency totaling $572.7 million due to 72 incidents caused by hacking and fraud. According to the latest¬†report¬†by Web3 platform Immunefi, the figure is up 70.3% from the $336.3 million lost in the first quarter and 112% from the second quarter of 2023, during which $265.5 million was stolen.

Since the beginning of the year, more than $900 million has been lost, which is 24% more than in the same period last year. The report notes that fraudsters have also changed their target. While in the first quarter, DeFi platforms were the main target of attackers, the situation changed in the second quarter. Centralized finance (CeFi) platforms suffered the most attacks in the second quarter, accounting for 70% ($401.4 million) of the losses. At the same time, decentralized financial platforms (DeFi) accounted for 30% ($171.3 million) of the losses in the quarter.

Mitchell Amador, founder and CEO of Immunefi, emphasized the severity of infrastructure compromises, stating,¬†*‚ÄúThis quarter highlights how infrastructure compromises can be the most devastating hacks in crypto, as a single compromise can lead to millions in damages.‚Äù*

"4 months later from ATH, fewer people talk about our precious reaching the $100K.  Many sources say that Bitcoin's all-time high is $73.738,00 and was reached on March 14, 2024.

If we got this close in 2021 nobody would question that $100K would be a matter of time.

Even before the halving the community spoke about the $100K. 

So what happened? We got more rational and less euforic? Or we don't belive anyone?

We are in a bullrun, or supposed to be. But in my opinion, the price performance wasn't been incredible because no economy is performing great right now. In doubt, zoom out.

For context, I decided to set up a recurring purchase of Bitcoin (BTC) using Euros (EUR). The purchase was executed yesterday at 20:03, and the average price I paid for Bitcoin was 58,042 EUR.

"Is it worth buying crypto with fiat on Binance? I'm new to using Binance and I have a question about buying crypto with a credit card. From what I've seen, there are two ways to do it:

1. Use the ""Buy Crypto"" page on Binance where you can buy directly with a credit card.
2. Deposit money using a card and then go to the trade page with all the charts to buy at the market price. This seems a bit complicated for new users like me.

What I want to know is whether these two options result in the same outcome, or if there are differences in the rates and fees charged. From my understanding, option 1 is more straightforward but might have higher fees, while option 2, despite being more complex, could potentially be cheaper.

Can anyone confirm if this is true? Are there other differences I should be aware of when deciding between these two methods? Any insights or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated!

"Why decentralized oracles are not performing in the market while smart contracts are? I am sharing whatever performance and growth numbers I could find. Chainlink being the leader in this space is being used by 401 projects. Even though we see TVL, hiring, smart contract industry, DEFI grow, the market cap of decentralized oracles has not caught up. What can be the issue here?

**1)** **TVS (Total Value Secured) -** TVS stands around **$49b** which is 51% of net TVL of the smart contract industry. This means smart contract industry is heavily dependent upon these oracle projects.

"15 years later, the Whitepaper looks like a politician's manifesto before election! 
I belive most of us have a positive opinion about it. Is a better storing of value than gold.

But in my opinion some parts of whitepaper are made to inspire and promissing a better future, but weren't really doable in the reality.

For example, the whitepaper states that Bitcoin was created to address ""the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model"" of traditional finance, where ""the cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions."" **But nowadays banks have lower fees than BTC.** 

I also hate banks and like the ideia of controlling my money. I identify myself with the message. But at the same time, the whitepaper feels to use  the same psycology of promises that politicians use.

"The Community Currency Bot, developed by Redditors to help facilitate web3 adoption, will be integrated in QuickSwap's subreddit, pending results of a governance vote. This is really cool news for the web3 communities on Reddit.  While Reddit has a very vibrant web3 community, very few web3 applications have been built for Reddit's users.  

After Reddit sunset their RCP and Moons, the web3 engagement on Reddit has been relatively low.  u/RickRibera93, a moderator here, r/ConeHeads, and creator of u/CommunityCurrencyBot has continually developed his application to help monetize content and empower communities on Reddit. 

While the Community Currency program has been steadily growing among smaller communities, it has not yet partnered with a major web3 company.  

All that may change very soon.

QuickSwap has released a governance proposal to integrate the Community Currency Bot in their own subreddit, r/QuickSwap.  If successful, this will mark the first time the Reddit native platform has teamed up with a credible web3 platform.  Quickswap will join the 50+ subreddits &amp; 25+ currencies supported by the bot, and their token $Quick will be the largest MC token in the program.

"""Spend and Replace"" is superior in every way to ""HODL"" It's funny how a meme that originally was about not selling your coins for fiat became a cultish dogma about never doing ANYTHING with your coins but hoarding them.

You can't become a currency of the future without users spending their coins. And what's funnier is that it's relatively easy to get the same benefits as HODLing if you just buy back whatever amount you spend after you spend it.

Your holdings stay the same but, instead of participating in the old, fucked up money system every time you make a purchase, you're supporting the small ecosystem of trailblazers who desperately NEED the support of early adopters.

The only way I think HODL wins over Spend and Replace is in memeability. But maybe ""SPEDN'REPLACE"" has some potential..

EDIT: I didn't directly make this important point:

By supporting a coin's ecosystem as it grows, you can have a huge influence on the network effect of that crypto, which will have a disproportionate effect on price in the long term.

So basically, it's a step you can take that benefits your investment.

"DD: Why I think BCH will be the true casualty of the Mt. Gox estate payouts 
Mt. Gox estate payouts are coming any day now, and while much attention has been focused on Bitcoin (BTC), it's crucial to consider the implications for Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Heres why I think BCH rather than BTC is poised to experience significant downward pressure, backed by detailed analysis of liquidity, technicals, fundamentals, and the sentiment among early BTC holders.

**1. Lower Liquidity Compared to BTC:**

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has substantially lower liquidity compared to Bitcoin (BTC). According to recent market data:

- BCH‚Äôs average daily trading volume is a fraction of BTC‚Äôs.
- The order book depth for BCH is significantly thinner, meaning it takes less volume to move the price of BCH compared to BTC.
- Liquidity constraints exacerbate price volatility, especially during large sell-offs.

The impending Mt. Gox payouts involve substantial amounts of BCH, and given the low liquidity environment, even a relatively small portion of these payouts hitting the market can lead to pronounced price drops.

**2. Overall Crummy Technicals:**

BCH‚Äôs technical indicators have been showing signs of weakness for a prolonged period:

- **Price Trends:** BCH has consistently been underperforming BTC and other major cryptocurrencies. The long-term price trend is downward, and recent price action has failed to break significant resistance levels.
- **Volume Analysis:** Trading volumes have been declining, indicating waning interest and participation in BCH markets.
- **Moving Averages:** BCH prices are below key moving averages (50-day, 200-day), indicating bearish momentum.

In a market where technicals already point to fragility, the sudden influx of sell-side pressure from Mt. Gox payouts can accelerate the downward momentum.

**3. Fundamental Issues:**

Several fundamental challenges plague BCH, making it less attractive compared to BTC:

- **Adoption and Use Case:** BCH has failed to achieve the level of adoption and use case success that BTC enjoys. Merchants and users predominantly prefer BTC for transactions and store of value.
- **Development and Innovation:** The BCH development community is smaller and less active compared to BTC, leading to slower innovation and fewer upgrades.
- **Security and Network Health:** BCH has a smaller network hash rate compared to BTC, making it more susceptible to attacks and network health issues.

These fundamental weaknesses mean that the market‚Äôs confidence in BCH is not as robust, leading to greater susceptibility to negative sentiment and sell-offs.

**4. Sentiment Among Early BTC Holders:**

Early BTC holders, who are the primary beneficiaries of the Mt. Gox payouts, are likely to have little conviction in BCH:

- **Historical Context:** These early adopters bought into the vision of BTC and are more likely to view BCH as a lesser offshoot. Many may not see BCH as a valuable part of their portfolio and will prefer to convert it into BTC or fiat.
- **Market Psychology:** Given BCH‚Äôs underperformance and technical/fundamental issues, the incentive to hold BCH is low. The rational move for many will be to liquidate their BCH holdings to reallocate into more promising assets.

This expected behavior will amplify the sell-side pressure on BCH as payouts are distributed.

**Conclusion:**

The combination of lower liquidity, weak technicals, fundamental challenges, and lack of conviction among early BTC holders sets the stage for a significant sell-off in BCH following the Mt. Gox estate payouts. Traders and investors should be prepared for heightened volatility and potential downward price movements in BCH in the coming days and weeks.

**Final Note:**

While this analysis paints a bearish picture for BCH, it‚Äôs important to approach the market with caution and conduct your own due diligence. Market dynamics can change rapidly, and staying informed is key to making sound investment decisions. This was ofc not financial advice.

"Convince me that Ripple (XRP) is not a Ponzi Scheme‚Ä¶ Out of all the big players in the crypto landscape, Ripple stands out to me as a Charlatan.

A for profit company that is trying to get banks and central banks to adopt its currency. Banks and central banks will be the last to adopt crypto and will only adopt something that the masses use.

This company only has a billion dollars in cash, has 1100 employees, and the rest of its assets, purportedly 25 billion, is in mostly ripple.

So essentially anytime the price goes up they are incentivized to sell Ripple from the balance sheet to help cover cost. What I don‚Äôt get is the ripple market cap is suppose to be 27 billion on top of all this per coin-market-cap.

"A tedious project to realize... Hi,

I had a not very innovative idea, but kind of a hard one to put in place.

I would like to create a trading bot that will manage several crypto-currencies on one or several wallets. Unlike the other bots, mine will be based on machine learning to make choices, and the end user will have alerts regarding new drops value. The trader will take decisions for the user, on several levels: calm, or risky.   
Money won't be staying virtual and on his wallet forever ; he'll be able to checkout in his real bank account if he desires to do so.

  
Now comes the tricky part: I have little knowledge of Rust.  
What considerations should I have ?

Are there similar projects with Solana ? -- I have searched but no other is as complete as mine and can manage different cryptocurrencies.

If real people use my product, is Solana really the choice to go ?

And finally : how much development time ?

"Please don‚Äôt shoot me‚Ä¶ I am a bitcoiner. A lot of my net worth is in bitcoin but, unlike many bitcoiners, I don‚Äôt automatically assume that every other token is a scam. 

I‚Äôve never invested in any other token but a good friend of mine has taken a shotgun approach, and spread his crypto investments across a dozen or so tokens, including bitcoin and Solana.

A couple of days ago he told me that he was going to dump all of his coins, other than bitcoin and Solana, and split his crypto investment 50/50 between bitcoin and Solana only. 

He was so bullish about Solana that I looked into Solana, for the first time, yesterday.

I don‚Äôt really understand how proof of history works, but it seems that a lot of pretty well known, and respected, crypto experts seem to be singing Solana‚Äôs praises. Solana seems to potentially have a lot going for it.

To get the other side of the story, I did a google search for ‚Äúcriticisms of Solana‚Äù, and I found one pretty harsh critic. In his critique (link below), he offers  evidence (that looks irrefutable) as proof that his harsh judgement is warranted.

This post is honestly not intended to be anti-Solana. I‚Äôd just be very interested to know whether there is another side to his negative stories about Solana.

Can anybody in this sub give me a critique of this critique‚Ä¶

In most developed countries there are specific laws around the creation and distribution of financial assets (crypto included) and I think if the government were to find that you aren't up to financial regulation, they can take action against you.

But are memecoins different? Do they fall in their own category of financial assets that exempt them from any legal action taken against you (provided that you aren't a rugger or make any false claims etc.). My other thought is that you are just the creator of the token and it is pump fun/moonshot that is the distributor so it is them that takes the blame somehow?

I just struggle to understand how easy it is to create your own token but somehow could land you in serious legal trouble down the line. Am i thinking too much about this? Obviously there's no section in the law that states anything about memecoins so idk if there even is a definitive answer. This is clearly an example of tech advancing faster than regulation so it's become quite a grey area for its legal justification.

TLDR; I want to create a token on moonshot but unsure if it's legal. Just wondering if anyone could explain more¬†or if I'm completely wrong.

"Do I need to swap every day?  Hey everyone, 

I have a stupid question but first time seeing a competition like this. 

Solflare wallet posted an event where you need to swap tokens in the wallet to be eligible for a reward. 

My question is do I need to swap every day to be able to get the reward? Or can I just do it one time and hope that they will pull my wallet one day during the campaign? 

  
Also, does anyone have any info on what needs to be done for the grand reward?

"Why do you think Solana will succeed long term? I see many people talking about Solana being the ETH-killer with its technological capabilities, but I never see anyone explaining what said capabilities actually are. It really seems to me like a lot of the sentiment is just bullish people repeating what they've been told by other bullish people. I didn't see any of that positivity when it was in the 20s.

Nowadays memecoins are basically synonymous with Solana, with a good majority of Solana-related content I see being about them. I only really see the more interesting DeFi stuff if I'm actively looking for it. Even this subreddit seems to be following the lead and concentrating on memecoins instead of actual technology.

So, with all that said, why do you think Solana will succeed in the long term? Do you think it actually has a future?

"üåü Optimal wallet traits and tips for copy trading on Solana 
üìä Solid ROI:
Aim for wallets with a ROI above 100%. This increases a change of success even with some percentages lost due to copy trade bots delays.

üèÜ High WinRate:
Look for a win rate over 60%. This indicates a trader with consistent profitable trades. Combine ROI and WinRate for a clear picture of profitability.

üõí Low Buys Amount:
It is easier to manage traders with average buys per trade less than 3.
Copy trade bots usually have 2 settings for buys:
1 - fixed amount in sol
2 - percent of trader's buy
In both cases you‚Äôll get a high level of spread between your positions from trade to trade if you choose a wallet which makes a lot of buy transactions per trade.

‚è±Ô∏è Longer Trade Durations:
Trades held for more than a minute are easier to copy because of less dependence on micro-scale price changes.

üåê Realistic Expectations:
Copying trades doesn‚Äôt guarantee identical results. Factors like bot speed, blockchain congestion, market cap, and original trader‚Äôs buy size can affect the outcome.


üí° Final Tips:
üü¢Start small and test. If results are positive, gradually increase your position size.
üü¢Use different Telegram accounts to have clear statistics on each trader you copy.

"RPC Delays and Benchmarks - Speed Comparison Between Private and Public RPCs Hey there, I feel like talking about RPCs and providers is almost taboo in the Solana DeFi and Trading ecosystem (which makes sense). I've been developing trading applications and infrastructure using mostly public and subscription-based RPCs and have encountered a few problems. One of the largest of these problems is the insane delay and desynchronization encountered when using these public ones. It's easy to infer that for creating high-frequency trading, sniper, or MEV bots, timing is essential. I wanted to share some of my data related to this topic to see if it's just me. **Furthermore, I'd like to ask anyone using privately-hosted archive nodes to share what kind of speed improvements they experience to see the cost-benefit analysis of investing into the hardware.** 

\* I know that AWS EC2 Spot Instances for running an archive node can be started for as little as about $6 an hour which isn't terrible (as long as it's not running 24/7).

  
The following data represents the average measured delay of incoming requests when using the [LogSubscribe](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/websocket/logssubscribe) websocket method across 3 of the most popular RPC providers.

* A link to the [degen.fun](http://degen.fun)d was posted on X at around 14:40:35 but by them, it seems like it wasn't tradable on the platform anymore (a buy attempt right after showed the error: trading closed) (https://x.com/bakedtoken/status/1807423996863857037)

"Solana wallet on hot protocol. Hot Protocol Wallet Now Supports Solana ‚Äì Your Thoughts?

Hey Solana community,

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on Hot Protocol expanding its support to include Solana. While we already have some solid wallet options for Solana, Hot Protocol stands out by integrating directly with Telegram for blazing-fast transactions. It connects seamlessly across major blockchains, including ton, solana, base(swap and bridge already started), bnb,near.

One of the standout features is the introduction of human-readable addresses for Near (e.g., `my_tg_username.tg`), which enhances user accessibility and simplifies transactions. Hot Protocol operates as a multi-party computation (MPC) wallet layered on top of Near's L1 protocol, ensuring decentralization without reliance on a single entity.

Looking forward to your opinions!

"Testing few criteria for investing in memecoins and avoid rugpulls OK, temptation of making 100x with memecoins is too exciting not to go degen style - but still I like to do my own research and analysis.

  
I actually don't like to fight sniper bots since I don't stand a chance but like to go in memecoins that could perform well at least for few weeks or months.



# My criteria for picking memecoins and finding red flags:

**Token holders distribution.** 

If Top 20 addresses hold 50% of total supply it's an instant red flag to invest in.

  
**Project's Ratio of X account followers : Telegram group members : Token holders**

Still fine tuning what healthy ratio to be between all 3 numbers.

  
**Who's the team behind the memecoin**

This one is a bit harder to get info but again - can just go to project's community and ask.

If team has launched successfully few memecoins before, then chance of their next token to do also well increases dramatically. 

  
**Score of project's X account based on their smart followers**

There are few free services that give this info so it only takes 1min to get such score.

  
**Keep revisiting and recording daily project's changes in numbers of followers, token holders**

Again simple spreadsheet is all it takes to record daily if project is growing amount of token holders, X account followers, size of community, vibes of community...",6,2024-07-02,solana,6,test criterion invest memecoin avoid rugpull ok temptation make memecoin exciting go degen style still like research analysis actually not like fight sniper bot since not stand chance like go memecoin could perform well least week month criterion pick memecoin find red flag token holder distribution top address hold total supply instant red flag invest project ratio x account follower telegram group member token holder still fine tune healthy ratio number team behind memecoin one bit hard get info go project community ask team launch successfully memecoin chance next token also well increase dramatically score project x account base smart follower free service give info take get score keep revisit record daily project change number follower token holder simple spreadsheet take record daily project grow amount token holder x account follower size community vibe community

"Picasso Network: Solana IBC Launch Sequence Picasso Network unveiled a significant advancement in its ecosystem: the launch of Solana Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC). This development marks a pivotal moment as Picasso continues to push the boundaries of cross-chain interoperability and scalability within the blockchain space. Solana IBC transfers are now operational on this Picasso App, marking a significant step forward in our mission to bring IBC everywhere.



Key Highlights of the Solana IBC Launch:



- Enhanced Cross-Chain Functionality: Picasso Network now supports advanced cross-chain interactions, facilitating seamless asset transfers between Solana and Cosmos networks. It marks the first and only¬†trust minimized connection of Solana with cosmos, Ethereum and Polkadot. This capability opens up new possibilities for developers and users alike, ensuring a more interconnected and efficient blockchain ecosystem.



- $PICA/$SOL Pool on Orca: Dive into the newly launched $PICA/$SOL liquidity pool on Orca, where Picasso has seeded initial liquidity and will progressively add more over the coming days. This initiative aims to enhance liquidity provision and accessibility for $PICA holders and the broader community.

 

- AVS Integration: The introduction of Solana IBC represented the initial implementation of an Address Verification System (AVS) within Picasso's restaking platform. Now operational on Solana, this capability paves the way for other AVS systems to join, leveraging Picasso's robust security and value offerings for their own benefits.



- MANTIS Games Season 1 Rewards: Participants in MANTIS Games Season 1 can now anticipate the distribution of their $PICA rewards, leveraging the efficiency and scalability enabled by Solana IBC.

"a lesson learned about copy trading i'm always keeping an eye out for smart wallets, usually never copy trade them but i had found a sneaky one that was too tempting not to try out.

i locked in the copy trade, it was making profitable trades all night. this wallet didn't lose and it's not like they were getting in super early/receiving airdrops/MEV, just clearly informed trades.

sit back and print right? well, as i was on my way to bed i noticed my bot going off like crazy. the wallet i was copying started going on a shopping spree. i thought ""hell yeah send it"" until i realized they were instantly selling what they bought and my bot was auto selling at a -25-30% loss.

i looked into it, the wallet started buying random dead pumpfun tokens, and then dumping on all the wallets copy trading. when i started copy trading this wallet i made sure i was the only one, but by the time i checked again there were at least 5 others. the wallet was making an instant 2x from us by doing this.

luckily i pretty much broke even, paused the copy trade and continued to watch. the wallet kept doing this and straight up liquidated 2 of the wallets that must've been AFK.  


i've now set my copy trades to purposely fail so i can still watch a smart wallet's trades without investing instantly.  
  
p.s. please don't bother telling me ""that's why you shouldn't do that"" or some bs, this is not a victim post and i don't blame the person for doing it, copy trading feels like leeching anyways.

  
TLDR;  
don't leave your copy trades completely unattended. if the wallet catches on, it can easily go buy bottomed out tokens and dump on you over and over until you either cancel the copy trade or lose all your sol.",32,2024-07-01,solana,32,lesson learn copy trading always keep eye smart wallet usually never copy trade find sneaky one tempting try lock copy trade make profitable trade night wallet not lose like get super earlyreceiving airdropsmev clearly inform trade sit back print right well way bed notice bot go like crazy wallet copy start go shopping spree think hell yeah send realize instantly sell buy bot auto selling loss look wallet start buy random dead pumpfun token dump wallet copy trading start copy trading wallet make sure one time check least other wallet make instant we luckily pretty much break even pause copy trade continue watch wallet keep straight liquidate wallet must afk set copy trade purposely fail still watch smart wallet trade without invest instantly ps please not bother tell not bs victim post not blame person copy trading feel like leech anyway tldr not leave copy trade completely unattended wallet catch easily go buy bottomed token dump either cancel copy trade lose sol

"Need Help with Selenium Script and Phantom Wallet Extension ‚Äì JavaScript Not Enabled in Popup Window Hello everyone,

I am reaching out to seek your assistance with an issue I've encountered while using a Selenium script with Chrome WebDriver to interact with the Phantom Wallet extension. My goal is to automate some processes that require inputting a password and confirming transactions. However, I‚Äôve run into a significant hurdle that I hope someone here can help me overcome.

**Issue Description:**

When my Selenium script triggers the Phantom Wallet extension, a new window pops up for the wallet's interface. My script is designed to switch to this new window and input the necessary password to proceed with transaction confirmations. Unfortunately, I am encountering a problem where JavaScript appears to be disabled in this popup window, which prevents my script from interacting with the elements as intended.

1. **Switching Windows**: My script successfully switches to the new window that the Phantom Wallet extension opens.
2. **Element Interaction**: I've attempted to locate and interact with input fields within this window, but JavaScript being disabled is a significant blocker.

* Launching Chrome with a specific user profile to ensure the extension is loaded.
